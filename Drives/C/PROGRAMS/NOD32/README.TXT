Dear User:

Welcome to the growing users' family of ESET's new, 32-bit generation 
of NOD32 Anti-virus System. We believe you, like many thousands of our current
users, will find this state-of-the-art system useful and reliable tool of your
anti-virus protection. 

NOD is a suit of three modules: NOD32 and AMON (memory resident Anti-virus 
MONitor), both running on Windows xx and NT platforms, and NOD32DOS. 
NOD32DOS has been developed for the use on DOS operating system platform. 

NOD32DOS can be executed from the CD, diskette, or a hard drive (it has to be
copied first). Unlike NOD32 or AMON, NOD32DOS is executed and controlled from 
the DOS command line. Information on (and description of) the parameters of 
the command line can be retrieved executing NOD32DOS using /? parameters.,
(i.e.: NOD32DOS /? ). 

No software is ever finished. This paradigm is valid, even more, for any
anti-virus package. All of us in ESET do our best to bring you, constantly,
the most reliable protection. Many of the improvements implemented in NOD32
are due to constructive comments of our clients. We appreciate any of your
feedback, questions and new ideas leading to improvement of our award winning 
product. To get information on the latest version of NOD32, please, visit us

Thank you for choosing NOD32!

 ÿCount Charactersÿ

  This macro counts the number of characters in the current file and
  displays the result. The count is limited to a marked block if it
  exists.

  The total number of characters reported is the number of bytes that
  the file or marked block would occupy on disk if it were saved,
  including line delimiter characters.

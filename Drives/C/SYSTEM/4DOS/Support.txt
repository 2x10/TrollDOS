We offer three support plans for our products, designed to meet a
range of support and service needs.  The first part of this file
explains the features of these plans.  The second part lists the
detailed terms and conditions which apply to each plan.

   * Standard Support is offered with all product purchases and is
     available at no additional charge.
     
   * Extended Support is a paid plan available on an annual basis,
     and includes Standard Support benefits plus private support via
     email or telephone, a monthly email newsletter, and electronic
     delivery of all major upgrades.
     
   * Premium Support is a paid plan available on an annual basis,
     and includes most Extended Support benefits, plus a 4-hour
     response time to support incidents, and physical delivery of
     all upgrades.

====================================================================

Standard Support

   This plan is included with your product purchase and continues as
   long as it is offered by JP Software.  It includes:
   
      * Access to JP Software's online support forum, available as a
        newsgroup, an email list, and a web-based archive.  (Also

        our software.)
        
      * Email notification of minor and major upgrades.
        
      * Downloadable maintenance upgrades.
   
   Standard Support does not include private email or telephone
   support, major upgrades, or any physical shipments.
   
   There is no annual fee for this plan.  Major upgrades may be
   purchased at our standard rates (shipping for physical copies is
   additional):
   
      * Single-system upgrades:  $34.95 for one product, $54.95 for
        two or more.

        codes and related materials.
        
      * Up to five private support incidents per plan year.  Support
        incidents are normally handled through private email;
        telephone support is also available on a callback basis
        within the US and Canada.
        
      * Monthly email technical newsletter, with notification of
        major and minor upgrades.

Premium Support
   
   This plan must be purchased on an annual basis.  It includes:

        plans (except the private support incidents available under
        Extended Support).
        
      * 4-hour response time to email or phone calls during Premium
        Support business hours (see the Support Plan Terms and
        Conditions for details).
        
      * Response outside normal business hours when available (not
        guaranteed).
        
      * A flat fee for each incident, regardless of the time
        required to resolve the issue.
        
      * Automatic physical shipment of all major upgrades, including
        standard printed documentation, plus automatic physical
        shipment of all minor upgrades for which physical media are

      * Incident charge (in addition to the annual fee) of $100 per
        incident, regardless of the amount of time it takes to
        answer the question or resolve the problem.
        
      * Additional surcharge of $20 for each call we make to
        customers outside the US and Canada who request Premium
        Support by telephone.

           JP Software Support Plan Terms and Conditions

This section explains the terms and conditions for each of our
support plans.  It should assist you in understanding clearly how
each support plan works and what its limitations are.

The following terms and conditions apply to ALL support plans (also
see the disclaimers and limitations at the end of this document):

   * Response Time:  Our goal is to respond to support questions
     within one business day, and in practice our responses have
     generally been much faster than this.  However, we do not
     promise or guarantee any specific response time, except as
     detailed elsewhere for Premium Support customers.
     
   * Problem Resolution:  We will attempt to resolve your problem or
     answer your question using our normal support procedures.  Our
     efforts are necessarily limited by the information you provide
     us, and the wide range of possible environments in which our
     products are used.  As a result we cannot guarantee that we
     will resolve your problem - only that we will review it and
     provide you with any information or suggestions we believe will
     be useful.  While we always welcome your input, the final
     determination of whether a problem should be resolved by
     providing information to you about how to use the product to
     meet your needs, by modifying our product to address a problem,
     by suggesting a workaround, by adjusting the documentation, or
     by some other method, is solely up to us.  We also reserve the
     right to close a support issue at our discretion if in our
     judgment we cannot provide any additional useful information
     despite repeated attempts.
     
   * Bug Fixes:  If we find a bug or documentation error in one of
     our products in the course of resolving your problem we will
     address it as part of our normal maintenance procedures; we do
     not provide bug fixes to individual customers for specific
     problems..  We will determine at our discretion whether a
     problem you report is a bug or program error, or is due to some
     other cause.
     
   * Problems in Operating Systems and Other Products:  When you
     report a problem to us we will work with you to determine if,
     in our best judgment, the problem is related to our product or
     to another company's software or hardware, or to another
     computer.  If we determine that the problem is not with our
     product then we will not be able to assist you further to
     resolve it, except to the extent that we may be able to suggest
     how to use our product's features to work around the other
     product's limitations.  If the problem appears to be a conflict
     with another specific product and you have a support contact
     for that product, we will attempt to work with the other
     manufacturer to resolve the issue if in our judgment they are
     responsive to us.
     
   * Requests for Information and Testing:  In order to understand
     your question or problem we may need additional information
     from you.  If this information is not provided responsively and
     in a timely fashion we may not be able to assist you further.
     We may also ask you to perform tests or other experiments;
     while we will do our best to make these non-destructive we
     cannot know the conditions on your system.  It is up to you to
     review the instructions you receive, ask clarifying questions
     if necessary, keep backup copies of all programs and data, and
     verify that the tests or experiments we request or the
     solutions we offer will not cause problems in your environment.

   * Products:  These plans apply only to products created and
     published by JP Software Inc. They do not apply to products of
     other companies which JP Software Inc. sells or resells.  In
     addition, Extended and Premium Support are not available for
     "legacy" products to which we are no longer adding major new
     features (4OS2, Take Command for OS/2, and Take Command/16).

   * Forum and Email Access:  The electronic resources you use to
     connect to our support staff (our forums, email boxes, etc.)
     are hosted by third parties and are not fully under our
     control.  While we work with our third party providers to keep
     these resources available to you, their availability, and our
     ability to access them in order to respond to you, is not
     guaranteed.
     
The following terms and conditions apply to both the EXTENDED
SUPPORT and PREMIUM SUPPORT plans:
     
   * Plan Term and Renewals:  Extended and Premium Support are
     purchased on an annual basis.  Service begins the day we charge
     your credit card or invoice you for the support plan, and
     terminates the previous day of the year, one year later.  This
     period of time is called a "plan year".  For example, if your
     order is processed on September 5, 2001 then your plan year
     ends on September 4, 2002, unless the plan is renewed prior to
     that date.  Renewal rates may be changed from time to time by
     JP Software at our discretion.
     
   * Incidents:  Each initial contact with our support department by
     private email or telephone on a new issue counts as one
     incident, except when the issue is determined to be
     non-technical and is forwarded to another department (e.g.
     Customer Service) for assistance.  Follow-up contact on the
     same issue while it is in progress or within one month
     thereafter does not count as a new incident, and questions
     posted through our support forum do not count as Extended or
     Premium Support incidents.  If you request Extended or Premium
     Support for multiple issues at the same time, and in our view
     the issues are unrelated and are complex enough to require
     significant effort, we may require that these be counted as
     multiple incidents.
     
   * Email and Telephone Support:  You may request Extended or
     Premium Support via email or telephone.  In most cases email is
     the preferred method and will give you the fastest response
     times.  However we also offer telephone support on a callback
     basis to Extended Support customers in the US and Canada, and
     to Premium Support customers worldwide (subject to
     international call surcharges, see below).  If you request
     telephone support it is crucial that you provide us with
     telephone numbers where we can reliably reach you directly
     during our normal business hours at the time your request is
     made.  If your issue requires us to review the content of files
     (batch files, configuration files, etc.) then we may request
     that you handle it by email, as it is usually very difficult to
     transfer such information by telephone.
     
   * Upgrade Shipments:  Any registration codes or physical product
     shipments sent to you under this plan will be sent as part of
     our normal shipping process, via methods we select.  While we
     will deliver the electronic and physical upgrade shipments, if
     any, which come with your plan in what we believe is a timely
     fashion, no specific delivery schedule is guaranteed.
     
The following condition applies only to the EXTENDED SUPPORT plan:
     
   * Refunds and Termination:  Extended Support is purchased on an
     annual basis and cannot be terminated or refunded after
     purchase.  However, if we feel we are unable to service your
     needs we may choose to terminate your Extended Support plan at
     any time.  If we do so we will notify you in writing, and will
     refund to you within 30 days an amount equal to your most
     recent support plan fee, less a pro-rated charge for any
     incidents already used.
     
The following terms and conditions apply only to the PREMIUM SUPPORT
plan:
     
   * Incident and Telephone Charges:  Each Premium Support incident
     will incur an incident charge, plus an international call
     surcharge for any required telephone callbacks outside the US
     and Canada.  Per-incident charges will be made at the rate set
     when you most recently purchased or renewed Premium Support,
     and will not change during your plan year.  International call
     surcharges may be changed form time to time by JP Software at
     our discretion.  Prior to requesting Premium Support you must
     have a current, valid credit card on file with us to cover
     these charges, and we may at our option delay response to your
     support request, without failing to meet our response time
     obligations, if proper credit card authorization cannot be
     obtained.
     
   * Response Time:  If a technician is not available immediately
     when you contact us, we will respond within four Premium
     Support business hours (8:30 AM - 5:00 PM eastern US time).
     This applies to both your initial contact and each follow-up
     contact on any incident.  If your request arrives less than
     four hours prior to the end of our Premium Support business
     hours, we may not respond until the next business day.  We may
     make reasonable changes to the Premium Support business hours
     at any time, as long as we notify you of the change via email
     or through information on our web site.  Requests which arrive
     outside of these hours will receive a response in the first
     four Premium Support business hours of the following business
     day.  While we may respond prior to that time, response outside
     of normal business hours is not guaranteed.
     
        We will meet our obligation to respond if we send you a
        substantive reply by email, or respond by telephone, within
        the required time, even if you are not available to receive
        the message when we respond, or the response does not
        resolve your question or problem.  If we can verify your
        contact with us, and do not respond within the promised
        response time at any point during our work on an incident,
        there will be no incident charge for that incident
        (international phone charges, if applicable, will still
        apply).  However, once an incident is opened, if we notify
        you that additional time is required for investigation of an
        issue then failure to respond to a subsequent contact within
        four hours will not trigger a refund of the incident charge.
        Your receipt of support with no incident charge is your ONLY
        remedy for any failure on our part to respond within the
        4-hour response time.  Our response time commitment is also
        subject to all of the other terms and conditions set forth
        herein.
     
   * Blackout Periods:  We may have occasional periods during which
     Premium Support is not available due to illness, staffing, or
     other similar issues.  We will use our best efforts to notify
     you of such periods in advance via email or through information
     on our web site.  During a blackout period you will be eligible
     to receive Extended Support services.  If blackout periods
     total more than two weeks during your plan year we will, at
     your request prior to the original end of the plan year, extend
     the renewal date for your plan by an amount equal to the total
     number of days of all blackout periods which occurred during
     the current plan year.

   * Refunds and Termination:  Premium Support comes with a
     satisfaction guarantee for incident charges.  If you feel that
     the assistance we provided to you for any incident did not meet
     your needs or expectations please contact us within 15 days
     after your last communication from us regarding the incident in
     question.  If we cannot resolve your concerns to your
     satisfaction we will refund the incident charge in full (less
     any international telephone charges).  Annual fees are not
     refundable.  However, if we feel we are unable to service your
     needs we may choose to terminate your Premium Support plan at
     any time.  If we do so we will notify you in writing, and will
     refund the unused portion of your annual fee, pro-rated for the
     portion of the year not yet completed.

The following disclaimers and limitations apply to ALL support
plans:
     
   DISCLAIMER:  We disclaim any and all warranties for all support
   provided under any of our support plans, express or implied,
   including any implied warranties of merchantability or fitness
   for a particular purpose.  You assume full responsibility for the
   implementation of any suggestions you receive from us, for the
   results thereof, for keeping backup copies of all programs and
   data, and for the safe conduct of any tests we request on your
   system.
   
   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  In no event shall we be liable, in
   connection with any support, software, or other materials or
   services offered or provided to you under any support plan, for:
   (a) any incidental, consequential, or punitive damages
   whatsoever; or (b) for any amount in excess of the most recent
   annual fee you have paid us, if any, for your support plan, over
   and above the purchase or upgrade price of your software.
   
   Support Plans Subject to Change:  All terms of, rates for, and
   services provided under any support plan may be changed at any
   time by JP Software at our sole discretion, and are not
   guaranteed, and any plan may be eliminated or discontinued at any
   time at our discretion.  However, we will not discontinue or
   change the terms or services for support plans for which you have
   paid an annual fee except at renewal time, or when, in our best
   judgment, the new terms and services are equal to or better than
   the old terms and services.

                        SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT


THIS AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is hereby entered into between ESET, Ltd.,
(the "Licensor") and the party executing this Agreement ("You") on the 
following terms and conditions:

1. Licensed Program. This is a license agreement between You and Licensor with
respect to NOD32, the accompanying Documentation and any fixes, releases,
upgrades, new versions or enhancements that may subsequently be issued
to You (the "Licensed Program").

2. Certain Preliminary Uses. The Licensed Program is distributed to You by
electronic download or on self-installing media as described in the
Documentation. You will need to install the Licensed Program on properly
configured and compatible computer equipment according to the Documentation.
You will also need to ensure that all required data is in proper format and
no other software or equipment having an adverse impact on the Licensed
Program are present.

3. Licensed Operating Environment.

 (a) Operating Environment.  Once You sign this Agreement, have completed
 activities described in Section 2 ("Certain Preliminary Uses") and provided
 You pay the applicable License Fees described or referenced in Section 7
 ("Price & Payment") when due, You will be deemed granted one (1) non-exclusive
 operations license(s) for the Licensed Program, in each case to install, store,
 load, execute and display (collectively, "Use") the Licensed Program on
 one (1) CPU of the class described in the Documentation (the "Licensed
 Operating Environment"). The Licensed Program is provided only in machine
 readable object code form.

 (b) Authorized Operators.  The Licensed Program will be operated solely by
 Your own employees ("Authorized Operators"). The Authorized Operators may Use
 the Licensed Program in the Licensed Operating Environment for the beneficial
 uses described in Section 4 ("Permitted Uses").

 (c) Disaster Recovery Exception.  In the event of a bona fide disaster such
 as a fire, flood, earthquake or civil disturbance, You may relocate and Use
 the Licensed Program on a back-up configuration substantially equivalent to
 the Licensed Operating Environment for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days.
 You may also temporarily appoint an independent disaster recovery center as an
 Authorized Operator during the pendency of the emergency. Upon completion of
 the emergency, You will return the Licensed Program to the original
 environment and certify the deletion of all copies from the back-up equipment.
 You will need to make and store in a safe place archival copies of valuable
 software or data that would be needed if a disaster occurred.

4. Permitted Uses.  Your Authorized Operators may Use the Licensed Program in
the Licensed Operating Environment strictly in support of Your internal
business operations and to process Your own data.

5. Reservation of Rights.

 (a) Rights to Licensed Program.  The intellectual property rights in the
 Licensed Program shall at all times remain the exclusive property of Licensor
 or other owner identified in the Documentation. By executing this Agreement
 and paying the applicable License Fee, You obtain a limited license to Use the
 Licensed Program in object code form. You agree not to disassemble, decompile
 or reverse engineer the Licensed Program. You also agree that any information
 obtained in violation of this restriction will be confidential information
 automatically and irrevocably deemed assigned to and owned exclusively by
 the owner of the Licensed Program. You will at all times use due diligence
 to safeguard and protect all such confidential and proprietary information
 pertaining to the Licensed Program. You will ensure that all marks, notices
 or legends pertaining to the origin, identity or ownership of the Licensed
 Program remain intact and clearly legible.

 (b) All Other Rights Reserved.  Except as expressly granted to You under
 another provision of this Agreement, Licensor reserves to itself and prohibits
 You (directly or indirectly, in whole or in part) from loaning, renting,
 leasing, sublicensing or otherwise distributing or operating the Licensed
 Program to or for the benefit of any third party, and from altering, adapting,
 translating or preparing any derivative work of the Licensed Program.
 The foregoing limitation does not prohibit Authorized Operators from making
 a copy of the Licensed Program for archival purposes or as an essential step
 in making Permitted Uses of the Licensed Program in the Licensed Operating
 Environment.

6. Product Support.  You may receive the following Product Support for so long
as Licensor generally offers to the public Hotline Service and Updates for
the Licensed Program.

 (a) Hotline Service.  You may obtain assistance for error correction and
 advice on the use and operation of the most current version of the Licensed
 Program through Licensor's electronic hotline service operated during
 Licensor's published business hours. You will need to provide sufficient
 information for Licensor to replicate and diagnose the reported problem.
 If appropriate, Licensor shall be provided reasonable access to the Licensed
 Program via remote dial-in contact, subject to Your approval and normal
 security requirements.

 (b) Updates. You may obtain copies of each revision or "Update" to the
 Licensed Program and associated Documentation which Licensor generally
 distributes to the public by paying prices from time to time announced by
 Licensor. The Licensor's designation of an item as a new version or
 an enhancement rather than an Update shall be conclusive unless clearly
 erroneous. Updates are available for download from Licensor's designated
 online system. You agree to install all Updates promptly, since the Licensor
 will only provide Product Support for the most recent version of the Licensed
 Program, incorporating all prior Updates.

 (c) Certain Conditions.  Licensor shall not be obligated to provide Product
 Support if: (i) the reported error was caused by unauthorized changes in
 Licensed Program source code, program parameters or other user adjustable
 features; (ii) the error results from operator error, errors in data or
 software not supplied by Licensor or use that exceeds the Permitted Use or
 is not in accordance with the Documentation, or (iii) the error is in a prior
 release that was corrected through issuance of an Update that You have not
 yet installed.

7. Price & Payment.

 (a) Price.  You agree to pay Licensor the applicable License Fee determined
 by reference to Licensor's published prices at the time this Licensed Program
 was ordered. Payment of the License Fee entitles You to Use the Licensed
 Program in accordance with this Agreement during the stated Term. If
 the License Fee is based on usage, then You will maintain any necessary usage
 records for calculating fees according to the Documentation. Any applicable
 Product Support Fees are referenced in Section 6 ("Product Support").

 (b) Payment.  Unless otherwise stated on Licensor's invoice, the applicable
 fees and shipping charges are payable by You promptly upon delivery. You will
 pay all sales, use, value-added, GST, personal property or other governmental
 tax or levy associated with this transaction (including interest and penalties
 imposed thereon) other than taxes based on the net income or profits of
 Licensor. If You fail to pay any amount when due, Your license to Use the
 Licensed Program will automatically terminate and You will pay all costs of
 enforcement, including reasonable legal fees.

8. Transfer of License.  You may transfer and assign not less than all of Your
rights to the Licensed Program under this Agreement by delivering the original
media and Documentation for the Licensed Program to the transferee and the
transferee's written consent to be bound by this Agreement. By transferring
this Agreement, You terminate any right to Your continued possession or Use
of the Licensed Program. You must promptly destroy all remaining copies of
the Licensed Program in Your possession or under Your control.

9. Warranties.  The following provisions are subject to Section 11 ("Limitation
of Remedies & Liabilities"). Any warranties are for Your benefit alone, it
being agreed they are not assignable and there are no third party beneficiaries
of them.

 (a) Noninfringement Warranty.  Licensor warrants it has the rights needed to
 enter into this Agreement and that, to the best of its knowledge and belief,
 Permitted Use by You of the Licensed Program in the Licensed Operating
 Environment will not infringe or misappropriate any United States copyright,
 trademark, patent, or the trade secrets of any third persons. If promptly
 notified of any claim to the contrary, Licensor shall (i) defend through
 litigation or obtain through negotiation Your right to continue using the
 Licensed Program; (ii) rework the Licensed Program to make it noninfringing
 while preserving the original functionality, or (iii) replace the Licensed
 Program with functionally equivalent software.

 (b) Software Media.  Licensor warrants any magnetic media on which the
 Licensed Program is recorded and the Documentation to be free from defects
 in tangible materials and accuracy of reproduction from the master media.
 Licensor will replace at no charge defective original media or Documentation
 returned to it with proof of payment.

 (c) No Performance Warranty. Except as provided in this Section, You agree
 that the Licensed Program and any services are provided strictly on an "as is"
 basis without any express or implied warranty, guarantee or other assurance
 of quality, conformity with specifications, reliability or functionality.
 You accept all risk for the suitability, performance or nonperformance of the
 Licensed Program. LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND
 DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE AND FITNESS FOR
 A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN
 IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS
 AGREEMENT GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH
 VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. STATEMENTS, IF ANY, REGARDING YEAR 2000 ARE
 "YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURES" ENTITLED TO CERTAIN PROTECTIONS UNDER
 FEDERAL LAW.

10. Software Locks & Undocumented Features.  The Licensor represents and
warrants that (i) the Licensed Program does not contain any timer, counter,
usage meter, lock or similar device (other than security features described
in the Documentation) that inhibits or in any way limits its ability to operate
according to the Documentation.

11. Limitation of Remedies & Liabilities.  The following provisions are a
material condition of this Agreement and reflect a fair allocation of risk:

 (a) Remedies.  You agree that if the Licensor violates any warranty or other
 provision of this Agreement, and Licensor determines that repair or other
 corrective action is not economically or technically feasible, Your sole and
 exclusive remedy will be to obtain a refund of License Fees paid by You.
 You also agree that legal remedies alone provide inadequate protection of
 Licensor's intellectual property rights in the Licensed Program and that,
 in addition to other relief, Licensor may without necessity of posting bond
 obtain temporary and permanent injunctions to enforce those rights.

 (b) Liabilities.  YOU AGREE LICENSOR IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY AMOUNT EXCEEDING
 THE LICENSE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU HEREUNDER. IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE
 LIABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY
 INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST SAVINGS OR
 PROFIT, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION EVEN IF LICENSOR IS NOTIFIED IN
 ADVANCE OF SUCH POSSIBILITY). THIS INCLUDES DAMAGES INCURRED BY YOU, YOUR
 CUSTOMERS OR ANY THIRD PARTY. THIS LIMITATION PROTECTS LICENSOR AND ANY
 DISTRIBUTOR OR RESELLER FROM WHOM YOU OBTAINED THE LICENSED PROGRAM. SOME
 STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL
 OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE FOREGOING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

12. Term & Termination.

 (a) Generally.  This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect for
 a period of one (1) year (renewable upon payment of the stated License Fee)
 unless terminated earlier in accordance with this or another Section of this
 Agreement. This Agreement will terminate automatically if You breach any
 provision of it. You may terminate this Agreement at any time at Your
 election.

 (b) Effect of Termination.  Termination of this Agreement will terminate Your
 right to possess or Use the Licensed Program. Upon termination for any reason,
 You agree to destroy the original and all copies of the Licensed Program
 (including Documentation) and cease all further Use of it. Termination will
 have no effect on Your obligation to safeguard and protect proprietary rights
 of Licensor under Section 5(a) ("Rights to Licensed Program"), disclaimers
 under Section 9 ("Warranties"), limitations under Section 11 ("Limitation of
 Remedies & Liabilities") or continuing assurances made under Section 14
 ("Export Regulations").

13. Disputes, Choice of Law.  Except for certain injunctive relief authorized
under Section 11 ("Limitation of Remedies & Liabilities") which may be brought
at any time, the parties agree that all disputes shall be submitted to a single
arbitrator under proceedings conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The award of the
arbitrator shall include a written explanation of the decision, shall be
limited to remedies otherwise available in court and shall be binding upon the
parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF
THE UNITED STATES AND CALIFORNIA, AND ANY ACTION SHALL BE INITIATED AND
MAINTAINED IN A FORUM OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN SUCH DESIGNATED STATE.
YOU WILL BRING ANY ACTION AGAINST LICENSOR WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CLAIM
ARISES, OR BE BARRED.

14. Export Regulations.  The transfer of technology across national boundaries
is regulated by the U.S. Government. You agree not to export or re-export the
Licensed Program without first obtaining any required export license or
governmental approval. You will not directly or indirectly export or re-export
(including by transmission) any regulated technology to any country to which
such activity is restricted by U.S. regulation or statute, without the prior
written consent, if required, of the Bureau of Export Administration of
the U.S. Department of Commerce. This provision and the assurances made herein

16. Miscellaneous.  This document constitutes the entire and exclusive
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and

Your signature entry in electronic form, or a hardcopy duplicate in good form,
shall be considered an original document with authenticated signature
admissible into evidence unless the document's authenticity is genuinely placed
in question. You may issue a purchase order, but it will have no substantive

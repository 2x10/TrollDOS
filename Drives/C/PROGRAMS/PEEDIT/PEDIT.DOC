 Welcome to Program Editor!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Pedit, short for Program Editor, is a freeware editor with lots of
   powerful options, many found exclusively in the "better" editors.

   A few examples are:

   - Both, columns and lines can easily be marked, for alterations
     and/or deletions.
   - There's an undo function!
   - Indentation of source files can very easily be changed.
   - Position marking and jumping.
   - Word wrap.
   - Insert/append another file into the current file.
   - An integrated spelling checker and thesaurus.
   - Copy and paste to other Windows applications.



 Important Notice:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Pedit is a freeware product.  This means that you can use it for your
   own personal use, or even in your company.  However, just using it is
   about all you are allowed to do.  Nobody is permitted to:

     A) Sell Pedit, either to make money or to lose money.  It may be
        placed on "Bulletin Board Services" which charge for membership
        to/for its services.  Examples: COMPUSERVE, PRODIGY, etc.
     B) Make any changes to the program apart from the editor settings.
     C) Distribute PEDIT.EXE without its accompanying files PEDIT.DOC,
        PEDIT.GIF, PEDAGENT.EXE, PEDITLGT.EXE, INSTALL.EXE & FILE_ID.DIZ.
     D) Do anything else which is not covered in items A, B, or C above.

   freeware, or to make dedicated (commercial) versions for third parties.

   Pedit is optimized for use with the 386 CPU or higher.

   If you are planning to include Pedit in some kind of freeware package,
   a notification to us is required.



 General:
~~~~~~~~~~

   For programming many people use the MS-DOS Editor.  It's good, and once
   you get to know the cursor movements and the copy/paste keys it's a fine
   tool to create software.

   However, hopping around in sources, and between files, some things become
   a nuisance.  If you wish to copy a line, you start marking. But if the
   cursor isn't on the start of the line, it marks two lines.  Also not a big
   problem, but the home key refuses to go to the line start, and stops at
   the first char, ignoring any spaces before that.  Adding or removing IF'S
   creates a lot of work, by inserting or removing indentation spaces.  This
   should be a piece of cake for a professional editor!  Many often used
   commands could definitely use a shortcut key.  In short, there are enough
   reasons to re-program the standard DOS editor.

   So, by mixing in some elements of Turbo-C, the Norton Guides, and even
   good old vi, together with some new ideas, this is a more powerful tool.

   It provides the look and feel of the MS-DOS Editor, but has an improved
   copy and paste function, an Undo function, a revert function, useful
   tables, a much improved file selection, many shortcut keys, allowing user
   "look and feel" changes, and all this at great speed.



 What's new in 4.00:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   It's always hard to figure out what the changes are.  New features are
   sometimes subtle improvements on long existing functions, so they're
   easily missed, and thus not used.  Let's summarize all the changes from
   version 3.30 to 4.00:

     - You can go to word processor mode, which word-wraps the lines as you
       type them.
     - The right mouse button will give a pop-up menu for cut, copy, paste,
       and other often used commands.
     - Backspace key in the file selection window to go up a directory.
     - The file selection can handle more files per directory.
     - Key to remove (empty) directories in the file selection window.
     - Key to delete all entries in the pick list.
     - Macro key to add Perl comments.
     - A light version of Pedit has been added in the package, so Pedit
       can easily included on rescue floppies and such.
     - Spell check now also works for marked lines.
     - Spell check HTML and RTF files.
     - Remove all HTML or RTF codes.
     - Bracket search is smarter, and also works for '(' and ')'.
     - HTML and RTF files with too long lines are more intelligently loaded.
     - CTRL-SHIFT-V will paste copied/cut columns into existing text.  Very
       powerful, don't forget to try this!
     - Much more Alt-F1 options: read the "Editor Settings:" chapter for more
       information on this.
     - New command-line option to go straight to a line number of a file.
     - A hex editor, INSPECT, has been included in the Pedit package.



 Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Pedit can just be copied to anywhere in the PATH, but to make full use
   of its strength, features, and integration with Windows, unzip all files
   from PEDIT.ZIP into a temporary directory, and run INSTALL.EXE.  This
   will set up Pedit for optimal use with Windows.

   !! Use only the included INSTALL.EXE if you're using Win95 or higher !!

   After full installation you will be able to:

   - Use the Windows printer drivers to print your files from Pedit.
   - In Explorer, right click on a file, then choose "Send To" -> "Pedit".
   - In Internet Explorer, from the "Edit" menu, select "Page", to view
     and edit the HTML source code of the web page you're looking at.



 Editing Keys:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The following key assignments may be displayed by pressing F1 within
   Pedit.  The following summary is offered to assist users who may need
   more complete information.

   Please note that Pedit supports many "old fashioned" editor keys, such
   as the familiar WordStar control-key sequences (i.e. Ctrl-Q F, Ctrl-L).
   Windows Copy/Paste keys are also supported.  Finally, most characters with
   ASCII values 1..31 can be entered, using Alt + the numeric keypad.

 * "Macros:"
      Assign multiple keystrokes to a single key.  Will act on a single
      line, or on a marked block (if a block is marked).  The real power
      of a macro is its ability to make changes over a marked block, so
      it will alter multiple lines.

      Puts '//'    before line/block. (C/C++/Java/JavaScript)  : Alt-/
      Puts '//'    after  line/block. (C/C++/Java/JavaScript)  : Alt-Shift-/
      Puts '/* */' around line/block. (C/C++/Java/JavaScript)  : Alt-\
      Puts '/* */' after  line/block. (C/C++/Java/JavaScript)  : Alt-Shift-\
      Puts ' = ;'  after  line/block. (C/C++/Java/JavaScript)  : Alt-=
      Puts ';'     before line/block. (ASM)                    : Alt-;
      Puts ';'     after  line/block. (ASM)                    : Alt-Shift-;
      Puts 'rem '  before line/block. (BASIC/DOS batch files)  : Alt-R
      Puts '>'     before line/block. (E-mail)                 : Alt-~
      Puts '> '    before line/block. (E-mail)                 : Alt-Shift-~
      Puts '#'     before line/block. (Perl)                   : Alt--
      Puts '#'     after  line/block. (Perl)                   : Alt-Shift--
      Adds two lines with brackets.   (C/C++/Java/JavaScript)  : Alt-[
      Change C/C++/Java function header into a pre-definition  : Ctrl-Q P



 Macros:
~~~~~~~~~

   Computer users frequently find themselves needing to perform a task
   repetitively.  This can be time-consuming and tedious.  Pedit provides a
   simple macro facility to make such tasks easier.

   Use Alt-F10 to start and stop recording the macro, use F10 to invoke
   this recorded macro.

   Starting and stopping a macro is possible any time.  Not only when you
   are in edit mode, but also in the File Selection menu, in menus, etc.

   (A maximum of 60 keys can be recorded.)



 Bracket Matching:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Alt-B key will perform bracket matching in your file.  The logic of
   this bracket matching is as follows:

   - If the cursor is on a ( or on a ), then that matching bracket is
     located.
   - Otherwise, the { or } closest to the cursor is used to search a
     match for.
   - When no match is found, nothing will happen.
   - For C programmers: if the current line is NOT proceeded by the \\
     comment characters, then all lines starting with \\ are skipped
     during the search.  This way any unbalanced { } in comments will
     not confuse the matching procedure.



 File Selection:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   When you want to open a file, using File-Open, (Ctrl-O), or File-Insert
   (Ctrl-K-R), you will go to the File Selection menu.  This menu offers
   some features.  These (mostly "hidden") features are explained here.

   - You can type the first letter of a filename to make selection easier.
     Use uppercase for directories.
   - Pressing Ctrl-Del will delete the selected file or directory (after
     confirmation).  Directories will only be removed if they're empty.
   - Pressing Ctrl-Ins will enable you to create a new directory.
   - F5 refreshes the current directory. Convenient when changing floppy
     disks and such.
   - Alt-S is a toggle between the file names and file sizes.
   - Alt-O brings you back to the original dir, the dir that was there when
     you popped up the File Selection menu.
   - Under Windows 95, Alt-L will toggle between long and short file names.
   - If you have drives with the letters of L, O, P, or S, then you cannot
     access the Alt-L, Alt-O, Alt-P, or Alt-S functions because you will
     access those drives instead.  In that case, instead of ALT, use
     ALT-SHIFT, such as Alt-Shift-P to select the function Alt-P.  Use same
     combo for L, O and S.
   - Instead of just Enter to select, use LShift-RShift-Enter for any
     extremely big file which is too big to be loaded into the editor.
     This will enable you to enter a file offset where to start loading.
   - Just as in Windows, you can use the Backspace key to go a directory
     "up".
   - Alt-P brings you to a list of previously visited directories and edited
     files.  Choosing one of these files will re-load this file.  Choosing
     one of these dirs will bring you back to that directory.  Very
     convenient for quickly jumping back and forth between multiple
     directories.
   - In the pick list, press 'P' to toggle a file "permanent". When a
     file is marked like this, it will always stay in the pick list, and
     never be thrown out until it's unmarked. Mark your regular visited
     files and directories, and they'll always be in the pick list.
   - In the pick list, press Ctrl-Del to delete all entries from the pick
     list.



 User Tips:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - If the shift key is pressed when Pedit is started, it won't show the
     file chooser, but re-load the last edited file.
   - When moving the cursor up and down when the shift key is pressed, whole
     lines are marked. When you move the cursor left or right, columns will
     be marked.
   - Use (keypad) Shift-5 to mark a whole line.
   - When you've marked a column, but you want to change it to a "whole-
     line-mark", press (keypad) Shift-5.
   - Use (keypad) 5 or ESC to un-mark.
   - Mark a word, then Copy it.  Now mark a line part over several lines.
     If you now Paste, the Copied word is inserted on every line that is
     marked.
   - After you've marked a column, you can start typing a line that will
     be inserted into every line of the column.
   - If you have compiler error messages on the DOS screen, use Alt-V to
     look at them. Also Alt-Shift-G is very convenient here.
   - All "Ok" input can also be answered with Space, Return, or Esc.
   - All "Yes/No" input can also be answered with Space or Return for "Yes",
     or Esc for "No".
   - All "Next/Previous/Stop" input can also be answered with Space or Return
     for "Next", or Esc for "Stop".
   - Word wrap "sees" empty lines, so it's possible to mark and wrap entire
     documents in one pass.
   - Use Ctrl-M as the last search character to find a string on the
     end of a line.  Can be combined with the next tip:
   - Use Ctrl-M as the first search character to find a string on the
     beginning of a line.
   - Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V and Ctrl-X can also be used in input fields,
     i.e. the "Find" input box.
   - Rename PEDIT.EXE to P.EXE, or just copy it over the DOS EDIT.EXE
   - Keep your private telephone numbers or other personal data at the
     office, and simply use the protect option to encrypt your data.
   - The longer you make your password, the more difficult it will be to
     crack.  Pedit defaults to 80 bit encryption, but if you use more than
     10 characters, Pedit will adjust the algorithm, and you can go up to
     112 bits encryption.

   General tips:

   - To accelerate the keyboard response rate, add the line
     "mode con rate=32 delay=1" to your AUTOEXEC.BAT. (On very early DOS
     versions this is not supported.)
   - In Windows, you can accelerate the keyboard response rate under
     "Control Panel", "Keyboard".
   - If you use EMM386 in your CONFIG.SYS, add the parameter "I=B000-B7FF".
     This will give you an extra 32Kb of free memory.  On some computers
     Windows will complain that you shouldn't do this, but on others it
     won't.



 Editor Settings:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The editor has many configurable settings, grouped together in an easy
   to use pop-up menu. Use Alt-F1 to invoke.  Changed settings will be saved
   when you exit the editor.  From then on these new settings are used every
   time Pedit is started.

   ====== Settings Page 1 ======

   Editor Style                - Change the general outlook of the screen and
                                 dialog windows.  Four different styles can
                                 be chosen. The "Mul" setting should be used
                                 for multibyte systems.

   Scroll Bar                  - Gives the possibility to display a scroll
                                 bar at the right hand side of the screen.

   Text Color                  - Color of the text.

   Background Color            - Background color of the edited text.

   Display Lines               - How many lines the editor will display.  Can
                                 be 25, 28, 43 or 50 lines, or it can keep
                                 the same lines mode as DOS is currently in.

   Show Column Number          - Shows the current column number on the
                                 status line.  No matter what this option is
                                 set to, the current line number will always
                                 be displayed.

   Show Char Under Cursor      - If enabled, this option shows on the status
                                 line the value of the current character
                                 where the cursor resides.  Values are shown
                                 in ASCII, decimal, and hex.

   Show Insert Mode            - Will show the status of the Insert mode
                                 on the status line.

   Full Path In Win95 Title    - A full path is more convenient when looking
                                 at the window itself, but file-name-only is
                                 better for the Alt-Tab task switcher.

   Convert ANSI <-> OEM        - Normally Pedit converts the DOS charset to
                                 the Windows charset in the clipboard, and
                                 vice verse.  Turn it off when you want to be
                                 able to preserve special chars like for
                                 example the (C) character or Chinese
                                 characters, or when you're copying data
                                 between 2 copies of Pedit, and this data
                                 contains characters higher than ASCII 127.

   Paste Moves Cursor          - When pasting, the cursor will move, just
                                 like the Windows paste.  Turn this option
                                 off to stay compatible with DOS Edit.

   ====== Settings Page 2 ======

   Use UMB                     - Squeezes a few Kb of extra memory out of
                                 your computer.  On some computers there
                                 isn't any extra memory to be found.  Win95
                                 is likely to have taken already every single
                                 byte available.

   Ignore Num Lock             - When selected, the Num Lock key looses its
                                 functionality, and the key pad keys will
                                 always be cursor keys.

   Tab Size                    - This is the Tab setting while editing, used
                                 by the Tab key, by Alt-. and by Alt-,

   Tab Expand Size             - When files are loaded, all Tabs are expanded
                                 to spaces.  Here you can indicate the Tab
                                 stop value.

   Ignore 0x0D                 - Some files, usually redirected output, have
                                 strange carriage returns in them.  Loading
                                 them causes unexpected empty lines to occur.
                                 Setting this option will try to normalize
                                 these files when loading them.  This option
                                 is default ON.  If you want to be able to
                                 read Mac files, turn it OFF.

   Clear After File Too Large  - When a file is loaded, and it's too large,
                                 the loaded part is discarded from the
                                 editor.  With this option it's possible to
                                 keep what's loaded in the editor.  Warning:
                                 since nearly all the memory is exhausted,
                                 you can't edit very much.  It's intended as
                                 an option to view (most of) very large
                                 files.

   Carriage Return             - Character(s) to be written at the end of the
                                 line, when saving your file.  Can be changed
                                 from DOS (0x0D0A) to SUN (0x0A) or
                                 MAC (0x0D).

   Make BAK File               - If selected, a .BAK file is created of the
                                 saved file.

   Ignore Words With 0-9       - Spell check will skip words with numeric
                                 characters in them.

   Ignore Words With _         - Spell check will skip words with underscores
                                 in them.

   ====== Settings Page 3 ======

   Button Pop-up Menu          - Defines which mouse button pops up a quick
                                 choose menu: right mouse, left mouse, or
                                 no pop-up.

   F2 is File-Save             - Can disable the F2-save option, for instance
                                 because you find F2 too quickly pressed by
                                 accident.

   Ctrl-S is File-Save         - Can disable the Ctrl-S-save option

   Ctrl-End direct to EOF      - If disabled, Ctrl-End will first go to
                                 the last position of a line, and only
                                 to the End Of File upon a second press.

   Ctrl-Home direct to SOF     - If disabled, Ctrl-End will first go to
                                 the first position of a line.

   Alt Highlights Menu Choices - Pressing ALT alone activates the menu,
                                 as in the MS-DOS Edit program.

   Save Changed Settings       - When settings are changed Pedit will
                                 normally ask for confirmation upon exit of
                                 the editor.  Can be changed to "Don't ask,
                                 just save" or to "Don't save". (For
                                 temporary changes.)

   Also Save Changed Margins   - Gives the possibility to save changed margin
                                 settings for Printing and Word Wrap.

   Save Pick List To Disk      - Lets Pedit save all the last visited files
                                 and directories to disk upon exit.  This
                                 list will be reloaded and used in the next
                                 Pedit session.

   Restore Original Directory  - Will upon exit go back to the directory
                                 where Pedit was started.

   ====== Settings All Pages ======

   Alt-D : Restore Defaults    - Alt-D will restore the "factory" defaults.



 Calling DOS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Alt-F9 will execute PEDBATCH.BAT.  This gives the possibility to execute a
   compiler or so from within Pedit.  This batch file must be in the current
   working directory or to be found in the path.  The name (without
   extension) and the extension of the current edited file will be passed as
   parameters %1 and %2 to the batch file.

   At the end of this doc you can find a sample batch file.

   Alt-Shift-F9 will shell to DOS.  Should we still tell not to load TSR's or
   to do other strange things here ?

   Before one of these two options is executed, the current edited file will
   be saved.  When returning to the editor it will be reloaded, so any
   changes made in DOS will be effective in the editor.

   Technically: Pedit tries to find the "COMSPEC=" setting in the environment
   to locate your COMMAND.COM.  If the setting isn't there, it tries to run
   C:\COMMAND.COM

   (Remember, after you went to DOS, you can always use Alt-V to look at the
   last DOS screen.)



 Pedit Windows Agent:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   As of version 3.20 and up, there's a nifty little plug-in for Pedit, to
   allow you to print through the Windows 95 printer drivers, and to perform
   other Pedit<->Windows integration tasks.

   When in Windows, run PEDAGENT.EXE, and it will remain in the tray,
   monitoring print requests from Pedit.  It will be the most convenient to
   put PEDAGENT.EXE in your StartUp directory, so it will be loaded every
   time Windows 95 starts.  To do that, drag a shortcut into the
   C:\Win95\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp directory.  It's also possible to do
   this through "Start Menu", "Settings", "Taskbar", "Start Menu Programs",
   "Advanced", and then dragging a shortcut to PEDAGENT.EXE into the StartUp
   directory there.

   In the Pedit print menu there's an option to use the Windows printer.
   Choose this option, and when the agent is running, Pedit will list out the
   available printers.  Select one, press Ok, and your file will be printed.

   The advantage is that networked printers and fax drivers can be selected
   to do the Pedit print job.  Also, files are spooled, so big files won't
   stop the operation of Pedit.  Future versions will allow you to select
   font and font size.



 Known Bugs/Limitations:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - Without EMS/XMS the copy/paste buffer is 16Kb.
   - The "Save Mark" option is limited to 8Kb.
   - Tabs are expanded to spaces, and stay as spaces.
   - Don't continue editing after a "Memory Low" warning!  If you really try
     hard, it's possible to push Pedit "over the edge".
   - Files with strange CR(LF) can create unwanted empty lines.  Supported
     are 0x0D0A, 0x0D, 0x0A & 0x0A0D.  If in trouble, try the setting
     "Ignore 0x0D".
   - Spelling checker user dictionary is limited to 16Kb.
   - Enormously big files cannot be spell checked/thesaured.  Also after some
     severe editing the spell checker memory could be in use by the editor.
     (In that case, save and reload the current file.)
   - The macro function records all keyboard hits, but not all mouse clicks.
   - The LShift-RShift-Enter sequence doesn't work on some computers. In
     that case, try the Enter key on the Num Pad.
   - On slow systems, Pedit has sometimes problems communicating with the
     Pedit Windows Agent.  Usually trying again will work.
   - Word wrap paragraph limit is 16Kb.


   !! Make sure you have the last version of Pedit !!  We already had many
   people reporting bugs or requesting features, which were already out or
   in.  This because they used an older version of Pedit.  Try to find the
   latest Pedit in the following place:

      http://www.goldshell.com/pedit

   Other download sites:
      Pedit can now be found on many popular freeware & shareware sites.
      Even on Windows-only sites!  However, it cannot be guaranteed that
      they have the latest version, so be sure to always check the Pedit
      home page.

   To get a notification when a new version of Pedit gets released, send an
   E-mail to "list@goldshell.com" with as subject "Subscribe Pedit", and
   you'll be automatically informed about new versions.  This list will be
   solely for Pedit update announcements, and maybe once in a while a
   newsletter.  So, don't worry about unsolicited E-mails.

   To get off the list, send an E-mail with subject "UnSubscribe Pedit".



 Future Plans/Additions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Anything could be baked into Pedit, the sky is the limit.  Lots of
   convenient and powerful options can be added.  Several ideas of other
   users have already been implemented, so if you have any suggestions,
   don't hesitate to mail them.  Who knows...?

   Send bugs, remarks, suggestions, and additions to the spell checker and
   thesaurus, to pedit@goldshell.com



 Pedit Goes Light:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   In the Pedit package there's a file called PEDITLGT.EXE.  This is the
   Light version of Pedit.  It's Pedit stripped of several options.  The
   purpose for this is to offer an editor which can easily be included on
   rescue floppies and such.

   The omitted options are:

   - Spell checker.
   - Thesaurus.
   - Printing through Windows.

   The remaining functionality is the same.



 Pedit Goes Pro:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Following in the footsteps of Pedit, there is now also GoldEdit, the
   pro version of Pedit.  Whereas most people consider Pedit already to
   be pro, GoldEdit goes even a few steps further.

   If you want the most up-to-date and advanced features, or even just
   want to support the development of Pedit, download and try GoldEdit.

   You can find GoldEdit at http://www.goldshell.com/goldedit



 Acknowledgements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Should we acknowledge these people, who bug us for changes, new options,
   better options, more, more, more, change this, don't like that, ... ?
   Of course!  Thank you all folks, for pushing us to this end result.

   Many thanks to David, for his never ending support, suggestions, proof
   reading, etc.  It's for sure that without him Pedit wouldn't have become
   what it is now.

   Special appreciation goes to Alexandre Pukall, for contributing his PC1
   cipher algorithm.

 For Programmers: Sample PEDBATCH.BAT:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This sample should give a rough idea how to use the Alt-F9 option as

   On the other hand... this still is the PROGRAM editor!

--------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The PK250UPD.ZIP file contains all the files necessary to update 
PKZIP 2.04g for DOS to PKZIP 2.50 for DOS. The contents of the 
PK250UPD.ZIP file will be extracted into the directory (e.g. 
c:\pkware) where the PKZIP 2.04g program files reside. A full 
installation of the REGISTERED version of PKZIP 2.04g for DOS *must*
reside in this directory for the update process to work properly. 

Applying the Update  
---------------------
To apply the PKZIP 2.50 for DOS update:

1. Follow all instructions for downloading the PKZIP 2.50 for DOS 
   update (i.e. PK250UPD.ZIP) file.
   
   or
   
   Insert the diskette labeled PKZIP for DOS Version 2.50 Update
   into an appropriate diskette drive.

2. Change to the drive and/or directory where the PK250UPD.ZIP file
   resides and (using PKUNZIP) extract the contents of this file into
   the PKZIP 2.04g installation directory (e.g. c:\pkware) by typing 
   a command similar to the following:
   
     pkunzip pk250upd.zip c:\pkware
 
   where "c:\pkware" is the directory where the original PKZIP 2.04g
   for DOS REGISTERED version file set resides. Several files will be
   extracted into this directory.
   
3. Change to aforementioned installation directory (e.g. c:\pkware)
   and type the following:

     pk250upd.bat

   Follow all instructions that appear. If the update process is
   successful, a message similar to the following will appear:
   
     Successfully updated PKZIP for DOS to Version 2.50!
     
   This completes the update process. A backup of the original PKZIP
   2.04g installation file set will be copied into the VER_204G
   directory nested under the installation/update directory. If you 
   wish to reapply the update you will need to do so on this 
   particular file set.
   
Note: The files contained in PK250UPD.ZIP file will only update the 
      English REGISTERED version of PKZIP 2.04g. The update process
      will preserve previously embedded Authenticity Verification 
      (i.e. AV) information.

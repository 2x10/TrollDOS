ÿÿLONGDATE.AML
 ÿGet Current Date in Long Formatÿ

  This macro displays the current date and time in long format, i.e.
  '2:18pm Friday, December 20, 1996'.

  Longdate can be run from an edit window or file manager window. If run
  from an edit window, the user will be prompted to enter the date into
  the edit window text.

  This macro calls Cfg\Cfgintnl.x to retrieve the long date in
  international format.

SATISFACTION GUARANTEE
----------------------

   If you are not fully satisfied with a JP Software product you may
   return it at any time up to 90 days after purchase for a refund
   of the full product price (shipping and rush order charges are
   not refundable).

   If you are dissatisfied with a product we sell which is not
   produced by JP Software you may return it for a full refund if in
   our judgment it is complete, is not damaged in any way, and is in
   resellable condition, or a 50% refund if not.

   Please contact us for a return authorization before returning any
   product for a refund.

   This satisfaction guarantee does not apply to multi-system
   licenses for more than 10 computers, or to purchases of more than
   10 individual copies at one time.  [Should you need to evaluate a
   product for a larger purchase, with the option to return it if it
   does not meet your needs, use your downloaded trial copy, or
   order a small license first (small licenses are upgradable to
   larger licenses with no price penalty, as described under
   Multi-System Licenses below).]

   See the LICENSE.TXT file or the printed material which came with
   your order for the complete text of our warranty and related
   disclaimers, which is separate from this satisfaction guarantee.


PRODUCT OVERVIEW
----------------

   JP Software's award-winning products are designed to make it
   easier to work with your computer by providing powerful,
   flexible, and easy to use command line tools.

   All of our primary products are "command processors":  They
   display the command prompt (for example, "C:\>" or "[C:\]"),
   allow you to enter commands, and interpret and execute the
   commands you type.

   Your operating system comes with a command processor which
   performs the same basic function (it's called COMMAND.COM in DOS
   and Windows 95/98/ME, or CMD.EXE in Windows NT/2000/XP).  As you
   probably know if you've used the command prompt at all, these
   built-in command processors are very limited, often out of date,
   and quite unfriendly.

   In contrast, our products are modern tools which make the command
   line easy and straightforward to use, rather than frustrating and
   inefficient.  They're compatible with the traditional command
   processors that come with your operating system, so the commands
   you're used to work just as you'd expect.  Then we've added
   hundreds of new features and capabilities that will make work at
   the command prompt simple, productive, and worthwhile.

   We've also created a comprehensive set of new batch file commands
   and functions that allow batch developers to perform in a few
   lines what used to take hundreds -- or couldn't be done at all.

   If you've never used our products, you're probably reading this
   because you downloaded a trial copy.  We encourage you to try
   this product (or any of the others we offer!) and see if you like
   it.  For a more detailed overview of features see Chapter 1 of
   the "Introduction and Installation Guide", in the file
   <PRODNAME>.TXT (i.e.  4DOS.TXT, 4NT.TXT, etc.), or our web site.
   Feel free to contact us with questions that come up during your
   evaluation.  You can also purchase any product and try it out,
   risk-free, under our full 90-day money-back satisfaction
   guarantee (see the previous section).

   All of our products offer very similar sets of features and
   commands.  Our goal is to make the same set of enhancements
   available in each operating environment, so you can move easily
   from one to another without having to limit your work, or switch
   tools.

   Our command processors are divided into two types:  "Text Mode" and
   "Graphical User Interface" (GUI) products.  A text mode command
   processor is the kind you're probably used to:  It displays commands
   and their output in a fixed font, typically with 80 columns in a line
   and 25 lines on the screen, and offers none of the "graphical"
   features like menus or toolbars that are common in GUI environments
   such as Windows.  A GUI command processor works very much
   like a text mode product, but runs in a GUI environment and has the
   "look and feel" appropriate to that environment.  GUI command
   processors aren't as flexible as their text-mode counterparts in
   handling text-mode application programs, but they often "fit" better
   in the GUI environment.  (For a more comprehensive document on
   choosing the right product, see our web site.)

   Our current products are:

      * 4DOS, our award-winning 16-bit DOS product, replaces the
        traditional DOS command processor (COMMAND.COM) under
        Windows 95/98/ME, MS-DOS / PC-DOS 3.0 or above, Novell DOS /
        OpenDOS 3.4 or above, and in OS/2 DOS sessions.

      * 4NT, a 32-bit Windows NT/2000/XP text-mode command
        processor, replaces Windows NT's CMD.EXE under Windows NT
        4.0, Windows 2000, and WIndows XP.  It is also supported
        under Windows 95/98/ME for those who need a 32-bit text mode
        command processor on that platform.

      * Take Command/32, our 32-bit Windows GUI command processor, runs
        under Windows 95/98/ME and under Windows NT/2000/XP.

   We also offer:
   
      - Product Packs and a CD which make it easy to combine products to
        suit your needs; see the next section (NEW COPIES) for details.

      - Multi-system licenses which allow you to run any product or set
        of products on multiple systems; see MULTI-SYSTEM LICENSES
        below.

      - Runtime products which let you run scripts or batch files across
        a group of systems without installing a complete updated command
        line; see RUNTIME PRODUCTS below.

   We also continue to offer the following legacy products (these
   products are supported to the best of our ability, but will not
   be upgraded with any major new features):

      * 4OS2, our 32-bit OS/2 text-mode command processor, replaces the
        default OS/2 command processor (CMD.EXE) under OS/2 Warp 3.0,
        Warp 4.0, and above.

      * Take Command for OS/2 is a 32-bit OS/2 Presentation Manager GUI
        command processor.  It runs under OS/2 Warp 3.0 and 4.0.

      * Take Command/16. a 16-bit Windows 3.x GUI command processor,
        runs under Windows 3.1 and 3.11, and Windows for Workgroups.


NEW COPIES
----------

   We offer each product individually at $69.95 (includes an
   Introduction and Installation Guide; the Reference Manual can be
   purchased separately for $19.95).

   A quick description of each product is in the previous section;
   for more details see the documentation which came with the
   product you downloaded, or the complete descriptions available on
   our web site.

   Our CD and Product Packs give you a wide range of options for
   purchasing multiple products, depending on your operating system
   and your needs and preferences:
      
   >> The JP CD SUITE includes all of our base products for those
      using multiple operating systems, and costs only $119.95!
                                                                  
      In many cases, you'll find the CD Suite offers better value
      than any Product Pack.  Also, when upgrade time comes, at
      current prices a CD upgrade costs the same as upgrading two
      individual products.  The CD Suite comes with complete on-line
      documentation and the Introduction and Installation Guide; if
      you need a Reference Manuals it's only $19.95.

   >> We also offer the following packs for those who need to use
      two complementary products on one system:
                                                                  
         * The Windows 95/98/ME Pack includes 4DOS and Take
           Command/32, for just $99.95.
   
         * The Windows NT/2000/XP Pack includes 4NT and Take
           Command/32 for $99.95.
   
   Finally, we offer a "Help Text Disk" for 4DOS, 4NT, and Take
   Command/32.  This disk, which is available for $19.95, contains
   the files you need to customize our help text (for use on your
   own system or by others within your organization who have
   purchased our products).  The 4DOS help text includes a help
   compiler; the 4NT and Take Command/32 help text require the
   Windows help compiler.  The 4DOS help text source file is ASCII;
   the 4NT and Take Command/32 source files are in Microsoft Word 97
   format.


MULTI-SYSTEM LICENSES
---------------------

   Multi-System Licenses allow you to run our enhanced command line
   tools on multiple systems, at a substantial discount.  Larger
   licenses are discounted even more heavily, and multi-product
   licenses are available as well (details on both are below).

   (If you need to run batch files across a group of systems without
   installing an updated command line see the next section on
   RUNTIME PRODUCTS.)

   Some typical license configurations and prices are shown below.
   For larger licenses or intermediate license sizes not shown,
   please request a specific quote on the license configuration that
   best meets your needs.

              500          6,500       8,150       9,750

   Multi-system licenses may be used at any number of physical
   sites, and on networked or stand-alone systems, as long as all
   support and distribution are handled through a single location.

   You can increase your license size at any time simply by paying
   the increase fee, which is the difference in price between the
   old and new licenses (if your old license is not for the current
   version you must upgrade it when you order the increase; see
   "Upgrades" above for information).  When you place a license
   increase order be sure to provide your serial number, and the old
   and new number of systems licensed.  Contact us for a quote on
   license sizes not listed above.

   Multi-system licenses include an Introduction and Installation
   Guide.  Reference Manuals and/or manual sets are available;
   contact us for pricing and item numbers.


RUNTIME PRODUCTS
----------------

   JP Software's Runtime products are advanced scripting tools
   designed to give IS managers, network administrators, and VARs
   the ability to run powerful batch scripts across a wide range of
   platforms in corporate and network environments.
   
   All four runtime products offer the full power of the
   corresponding complete command line tools described above.  The
   only functional difference between the runtime version and the
   complete version of each product is that the runtime version can
   only run batch files, and does not display the normal interactive
   command prompt (e.g.  "C:\>").

   The runtime products are:
   
      4DOS Runtime:  16-bit text-based scripting for Windows
      95/98/ME and DOS.
   
      4NT Runtime:  32-bit text-based scripting for Windows
      NT/2000/XP and Windows 95/98/ME.
   
      Take Command/32 Runtime:  GUI-based scripting for Windows
      95/98/ME and Windows NT/2000/XP.
   
   These tools are perfect when you don't want to learn a whole new
   language, but you need a lot more than what traditional batch
   files offer.

   Some typical runtime product configurations and prices are shown
   below.  For larger licenses or intermediate license sizes not
   shown, please request a specific quote on the license
   configuration that best meets your needs.

   You can increase your runtime license size at any time simply by
   paying the increase fee, which is the difference in price between
   the old and new licenses.
   
   Runtime licenses may be used at any number of physical sites
   within your organization.  They can also be used on networked or
   stand-alone systems, as long as all support and distribution are
   handled through a single location.
   
   Each runtime license includes a single-seat development license
   for the corresponding base product, allowing the developer full
   access to the enhanced script language along with debugging tools
   and the company's complete interactive command line toolset.
   Licenses can be customized to include additional development
   seats at our standard multi-system license rates.
   
   We also offer two special kinds of licenses.  Please contact us
   for details on:
   
      - Use in "thin-client" environments under Microsoft's Windows
        NT Terminal Server or Citrix Winframe / Metaframe
        
      - OEM licensing for VARs and developers who wish to distribute
        products or script-based tools to multiple customers using
        4DOS, 4NT, or Take Command/32 runtime scripts.


UPGRADES
--------

   Individual product upgrades are $34.95 for the first product, and
   $19.95 for each additional product.  Please include your current
   serial number for each product you are upgrading.  The JP CD
   Suite upgrade is $54.95.

   Switching operating systems?  Not sure which operating system you'll
   be using in the future?  Own some of our products already?  Convert
   from your current individual product(s) to the JP CD Suite (listed on
   the upgrade order form under Add-Ons / Conversions) and you'll
   receive all of our command line tools, including upgrades
   for all the products you own now, for just $69.95!

   Additional Upgrade Notes:

      Individual product upgrade and add-on prices listed here and
      on the upgrade order form are valid for those who own an up to
      date, registered copy of 4DOS 5.5 or above 4NT 2.5 or above,
      or any version of Take Command.  Upgrades from older versions
      (4DOS 5.0 and below, 4NT 2.0 and below) are an additional $10
      per product.

      If you have a multi-system license and it is listed in the
      table below, you can order an upgrade at that price -- just be
      sure to provide your serial number and the number of systems
      licensed with your order.  If your license size is not listed,
      contact us for a quote.
      
      To increase your license size at the same time as you upgrade
      you must purchase the upgrade, and also pay the appropriate
      license increase fee; see MULTI-SYSTEM LICENSES above for
      increase fees.

ADD-ONS and CONVERSIONS
-----------------------

   We offer substantial discounts when you need to purchase an
   additional product for use on the same system as your current JP
   Software product(s), switch from one product to another, or
   upgrade to the JP CD Suite with all products.

   To add a product to your current system, or switch from one
   product to another, list the new product(s) you need on the order
   form; the cost is only $34.95 each.  And to convert to the JP CD
   Suite with all products you'll pay just $69.95 -- including
   upgrades for all products you currently own.

   These reduced prices are NOT valid if you need another product
   for use on a different system (e.g., you have 4DOS on one system
   and want to keep using it, and also put 4NT on a different
   system).  In that case you'll need to use our standard new system
   prices (see "New Copies and Product Packs" above for details),
   or move to a multi-system license (see "Multi-System Licenses"
   above).

   funds, and drawn on a US or Canadian bank.  Postal money orders
   in US funds are also acceptable.  Sorry, we cannot accept
   EuroCheques (our bank can't cash them).  See the next section for
   information on COD shipments.

   Cash may be sent at your own risk, and must be U.S. currency.  If
   you do send cash we strongly recommend using Registered Mail.

   Purchase Orders are accepted from established companies and
   government agencies, on 30-day terms.  Credit references are
   required for new customers.  Orders under $100 must be prepaid.
   Contact us for additional requirements before submitting a
   purchase order from outside the U.S. and Canada.


SHIPPING
--------

   Orders typically require 2 - 3 business days processing time
   before shipment, and may take more or less depending on our order
   backlog.  Shipping and delivery times may increase significantly
   during peak upgrade periods.

   In the U.S. we ship via UPS Ground service (delivery typically 1
   - 8 days after shipment, depending on your location), at the
   rates shown on the order form.  Shipments to Alaska, Hawaii, and
   APO or FPO addresses are normally sent via U.S. Priority Mail
   (use rates shown for UPS Ground service).

   Contact us for other expedited domestic shipping options
   including UPS 2-day (BLue Label), overnight (Red Label), FedEx
   services, and other carriers.

   COD shipping is normally available only for UPS shipments within
   the U.S., and adds $7 to the UPS shipping charge shown on the
   order form.

   If you receive international shipments via a freight forwarder in
   the U.S. please include both your address and the U.S. shipping
   address, and use the U.S. rate chart on the order form.

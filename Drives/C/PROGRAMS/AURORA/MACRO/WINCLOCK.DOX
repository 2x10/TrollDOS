ÿÿWINCLOCK.AML
 ÿEdit Window Clockÿ

  This macro displays a real-time clock on an edit window. The clock is
  displayed on the horizontal scroll bar, or on the menu bar if the
  horizontal scroll bar is not present.

  Winclock updates the clock every 300 milliseconds, when the top window
  is an edit window and no mouse buttons are pressed down.

ÿÿTABS.AML
 ÿEntab/Detabÿ

  This macro converts tab characters to spaces (Detab), or converts
  spaces to tab characters (Entab) in the current edit window. The
  conversion is limited to a marked block, if it exists in the edit
  window.

  The current tab width (the value of the _TabWidth configuration
  variable) is used as the tab width for the conversion.

  Note: this macro will run faster if Undo is turned Off on the Set menu.

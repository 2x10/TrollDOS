 MaxDIR  v2.29      [Documentation - DI.EXE]   (C)1995-2005 MSH Softworks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       [ This utility has always been and always will be FREEWARE ]

--> Type DI /? for a list of command-switches.  Use README.TXT for help. <--


INSTALLATION:  

  Simply copy the MaxDIR files into your OS directory, or any place else
that is specified in your AUTOEXEC.BAT's PATH= statement.  Also, you can
rename it to anything you wish, such as D.EXE, which is how I use it.

IMPORTANT!:  All of the files MUST be in the same directory for MaxDIR to
             work properly.  DI.EXE, CFG.EXE, and MAXDIR.CFG.


NOTE:  For Windows NT/2000, you should extract all files to the C:\WINNT
       directory.

NOTE:  For Windows95/98/ME/XP, you should extract all files to the
       C:\WINDOWS directory.

NOTE:  For DOS, you should extract all files to the C:\DOS (or SYSTEM)
       directory.  You must make sure the directory is in the set PATH=
       statement.


ABOUT THE FILES:

DI.EXE     :This is MaxDIR.  Type DI to get a directory.

CFG.EXE    :This is MaxDIR Config.  This program lets you make up to 25
            custom config files for MaxDIR to use.  The documentation is
            built in to the help system.  Press F1 to find out how to use it.

MAXDIR.CFG :This is the default configuration file.  You may create up to 25
            different .CFG files to use with MaxDIR.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

MaxDIR OPTIONS:

  You may change the way MaxDIR shows files by using Command-Switches.  For
example, by typing  DI /F  MaxDIR will Alphabetize files by Filename instead
of by File Extension.  Here are the available command-switches:

By default, MaxDIR shows files alpha by file extension, ordered up/down.

/e   - Sort Files by Extension. (Default)
/f   - Sort Files by Filename.
/t   - Sort Files by Date/Time.
/s   - Sort Files by Size.
/n   - Disable Sorting.
/w   - Show Files Ordered Up-Down. (Default)
/l   - Show Files Ordered Left-to-Right.
/a   - Show Hidden/System files.
/d   - Show Directories ONLY.
/#   - Number of Columns (1,2,4,6) (Default: 4)
/c   - No Color.  (Output can Redirect)
/j   - Show Colors in ANSI format.  (Output can Redirect)
/u   - Show Files in ALL-Uppercase.
/v   - Disable Show Available Drives.
/p   - Disable Pause at full screen.
/o   - Use BIOS Video Addressing.
/i   - Include DIR clusters in 'Bytes Consumed'.
/x   - Show eXtra Drive Information.
/b   - Show MaxDIR Location, Build ID, and DOS Version Info.
/z   - Disable custom configuration. (Use Default Settings.)
/zfilename - Use custom configuration CFG file. (Don't add .CFG)


You can use more than one switch, in any order.  The path to sort must be the
last thing on the command line.

EXAMPLES:

di                -Will show files in current dir, alpha by extension.

di /?             -Will show Command Line Switches and info about MaxDIR.

di /s             -Will show files sorted from smallest to largest.

di /f /u /l ms*.* -Will show files in current dir starting with MS, alpha
                   by filename, in all uppercase, ordered left-to-right.

di /u e:\dos      -Will show files under the Dos dir on drive E, alpha 
                   by extension, in all uppercase.

di /d /x          -Will show directories under current dir, along with
                   extra info about the drive.

di /n /p          -Will show files, unsorted, with no pausing when the
                   screen fills up.

di /a             -Will show ALL files(including hidden and system files),
                   with hidden dirs at the end of the dir list, and all
                   hidden files at the end of the files list, with their
                   first characters in lower case.

di /v             -Will show files in current dir, alpha by extension,
                   without showing available drives.

di /zfilename     -Will use the custom configuration file: filename.cfg
                   Remember:  Don't add the .CFG in the command.

di \              -Will show the current drive's Root directory, alpha by
                   extension.

di /2             -Will show files in current dir, alpha by extension,
                   in 2 columns (which shows dates and times)

di /c > file.txt  -Will list files in current dir, sending output to
                   File.txt. (no color)

di /j > file.txt  -Will list files in current dir, sending output to
                   File.txt. (using ANSI color codes.)

di /c > lpt2      -Will list files in current dir, sending output to
                   printer on LPT2


TIP:   When outputting to another device, be sure to use the /p option
       to disable PAUSE.  Otherwise, you'll have to keep pressing a key
       until the output is completed.

NOTE:  Even though the /n option specifies No Sorting, all directories will
       still be pushed to the front of the listing, but they will not be
       sorted.

NOTE2: The /a option always pushes hidden/system files to the end of the
       list.  Hidden/System files are denoted by a lowercase first letter
       of the Filename and Extension.

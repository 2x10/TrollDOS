  files. By default, the two files are the current file and the
  associated backup file. The following options can be specified:

     - Show Line Numbers
     - Ignore Case
     - Show First and Last Lines Only
     - Use Open Files if Possible

  The Dos command 'fc' is used to perform the comparision.

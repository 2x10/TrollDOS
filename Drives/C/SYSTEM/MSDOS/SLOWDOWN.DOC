     WHAT IS SLOWDOWN?
     อออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN is a program that temporarily Slows Down your computer, so that
     it runs like one of the older, slower computers.  Of course, nowadays
     people generally think that the faster a computer runs, the better --
     why would anyone ever want to slow a computer down?  Believe it or not,
     there are a some really good reasons.

     The first reason is that there are many very good, useful (old) programs
     that were designed to run on these old, slow computers, and they do not
     run correctly on a newer, faster computer.  The old programs either
     don't run at all (they "blow up" -- the computer either totally locks up
     or you get a "Run-time Error" of some sort), or they run in such a way
     that you can't use them.  When I first wrote SLOWDOWN (many years ago),
     about the only kinds of programs that really seemed to have problems
     were ones that required lots of "real-time" interaction with the user
     (like arcade-type games).  In my opinion, any program that requires such
     "real-time" interaction should be designed to run on any computer, no
     matter how fast (or how slow) it is.  Unfortunately, very few programs
     are actually designed that way.

     Nowadays, especially with the really fast computers, there are lots of
     different types of programs that have problems with fast computers (not
     just games).  I've personally seen or heard of different typing tutors,
     communications, network, database, and copy-protection programs that
     have problems on new computers.  I'm sure there is at least one program
     in just about any software category you could name that would either
     blow up or be unusable on one of the latest computers.  You can't even
     buy the old, slow computers anymore, but with SLOWDOWN you may still be
     able to use the programs.


     The second reason you may want to temporarily slow down your computer is
     when you are trying troubleshoot something that is going wrong with
     another program.  Sometimes, you know something is wrong, but things
     happen so fast you can't tell exactly what or even where the problem is
     (especially if error messages or status messages that flash by on the
     screen so fast you can't read them).  With SLOWDOWN, you may actually be
     able to see what's on the screen before it disappears again.


     While SLOWDOWN is installed in memory, you are able to change the Speed
     of the computer with the keyboard using Hot-Keys (these are discussed in
     detail in the "HOT-KEYS" section below, page 28).  This lets you control
     exactly when and how fast your computer runs.  There are also several
     different ways of telling SLOWDOWN how fast you want your computer to
     run from the command-line (the different ways are discussed in the
     "OPTIONS" section below, starting on page 6).




                       SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 3 of 44



     There are dozens of other "slowdown" programs already out there, so what
     makes SLOWDOWN different enough from the others that I even bothered to
     write it?  The main thing is flexibility -- SCANCODE includes in one
     program features that you may find sporadically in other "slowdown"
     programs, but never all together in one place.  SLOWDOWN is also very
     small (it uses less than 2000 bytes of memory), and, perhaps most
     importantly, is free.

     HOW TO USE SLOWDOWN
     อออออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN can be used in two basic ways.  The first way is to install
     SLOWDOWN "permanently" as a Terminate-but-Stay-Resident (TSR) program on
     your computer.  If you do this, the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys will be available
     for you to use almost any time you want (see the "HOT-KEYS" section
     below on page 28).  You can instantly Slow Down or speed up your
     computer using the keyboard, even while other programs are running.
     This gives you much more control of your computer than you have now.

     To have SLOWDOWN be "permanent" like this, you should make sure it is
     installed every time you turn your computer on.  You can do this by
     putting a simple "SLOWDOWN" line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  A
     "SLOWDOWN" line (with no Options) will install SLOWDOWN into memory, but
     SLOWDOWN will not do anything to change the speed of your computer yet.
     You can then "activate" and "deactivate" SLOWDOWN when you want, either
     by using the HOT-KEYS, or by running SLOWDOWN again with command-line
     Options.  SLOWDOWN will never install itself into memory more than once,
     so if you do try to run it more than once, it will simply update (change
     the settings of) the SLOWDOWN that is already in memory.

     When installed as a TSR, SLOWDOWN uses less than 2K of memory.  This is
     not a lot of memory, but then again computer memory is quite precious.
     You can use the DOS LH or LOADHI commands to load SCANCODE into High
     Memory (this will preserve more memory for your "normal" applications).
     You can also Uninstall SLOWDOWN from memory completely with the
     UNINSTALL Option (page 24).


     Of course, many people would rather have the computer simply run as fast
     as it can nearly all of the time.  You may only have a few programs that
     require the use of SLOWDOWN, you don't want the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys
     cluttering things up and confusing you, and you don't want SLOWDOWN
     wasting any of your memory at times when it's not actually doing
     something.  You can also have SLOWDOWN Slow a single Program Down, and
     when that Program is finished, your computer will automatically return
     back to normal speed.  How to do this is discussed more fully under the
     PROGRAM Option below (page 16).


     SLOWDOWN is a DOS program, and, as with nearly all DOS programs, the
     easiest and best way to use it is in DOS batch files.  If you use any
     DOS programs at all (including most versions of Microsoft Windows, which
     are nothing more than large, slow DOS programs themselves anyway), you
     really need to learn to write and use batch files.  It will save you
     literally hours of unnecessary work and frustration in the years to
     come.  There are some example batch file excerpts given in the sections
     below.  Once you figure out the settings you need to get SLOWDOWN to
     work with a particular program, for heaven's sake, write yourself a
     batch file to automate the process for you the next time.


                       SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 5 of 44



     OPTIONS
     อออออออ

     NOTE: As of version 2.00, some of the SLOWDOWN Options work quite
     differently than they did in previous versions.  If you have used a
     previous version of SLOWDOWN, and have created batch files or
     environment variables using the previous version of SLOWDOWN, you will
     probably need to go back and modify them.


     SLOWDOWN is fairly liberal in what it will accept as command-line
     Options.  Each Option must be entered separately, must start with a "/"
     (except the PROGRAM Option), and can either be upper- or lower-case.
     The Options do not need to be separated by spaces (except the PROGRAM
     Option), and can be entered in any order (except the PROGRAM Option,
     which must be last).  If the same Option is entered twice with two
     different settings, or conflicting Options are entered, the last one
     entered takes precedence.  Options that require a number or character to
     be entered as part of the Option (indicated by a ":" separator in the
     Option details below) can either use a ":" or "=" as the separator.

     Note also that there are usually several different ways to enter the
     same Option.  For example, to have SLOWDOWN be QUIET (not give you any
     status messages as it is loading), you could type any of the following
     from the command line (or from a batch file):

       SLOWDOWN /Q
       SLOWDOWN /Quiet
       SLOWDOWN /ShutUp

     Most of the Options have a "shorthand" code ("/Q" in this case) and one
     or more "longhand" codes ("/Quiet" and "/ShutUp" in this example).  The
     shorthand codes take up less room and are faster and easier to type, but
     the longhand codes are easier to remember and to read and to understand.
     You can use whichever makes the most sense to you.


     For instance, the following are equivalent:

       SLOWDOWN /Quiet/Speed=1000 PROGRAM ProgramOptions
       SLOWDOWN /Q        /s:1000 PROGRAM ProgramOptions


     The PROGRAM Option, if you have one, must be the last thing entered on
     the command-line.  The PROGRAM Option allows you to run a single
     executable PROGRAM (here called "PROGRAM ProgramOptions"), and after the
     PROGRAM is done, SLOWDOWN will automatically return the computer back to
     the Speed it was running before you started running PROGRAM.  The
     PROGRAM Option is discussed more fully below (page 16).




                       SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 6 of 44



     There are several Options to control how fast you want the computer to
     run.

     Each of the "speed control" Options has a wide range of input values.
     At one end of the range of values, you will be telling SLOWDOWN to slow
     down the computer as much as it can.  If you select this value, SLOWDOWN
     will run the computer as slow as it believes it can safely do.  SLOWDOWN
     should not stop the computer completely, but the computer will run VERY
     slowly and may even seem like it is completely stopped.

     At the other end of the range of values, you will be telling SLOWDOWN to
     run the computer faster than it can possibly go.  In this case, SLOWDOWN
     will not Slow Down the computer at all.  Exactly what value you use to
     tell SLOWDOWN how much to slow the computer down depends on which "speed
     control" Option you decide to use.  This should become obvious as you
     read the details for each Option.


     Some of the "speed control" Options also refer to a thing called a
     Slowdown-Unit (or an SU).  This is a Unit of Speed that SLOWDOWN uses
     internally, both to measure how fast the computer is and to Slow the
     computer Down.  Slowdown-Units are unique to SLOWDOWN, and exactly what
     they are is described below in "HOW SLOWDOWN WORKS" (page 33).  When you
     see the references to Slowdown-Units or SU's, just remember that they
     are the "things" SLOWDOWN uses internally to measure Speed.


     * /M:nn
     * /MHz:nn  /MHz486:nn

          This Option tells SLOWDOWN to run your computer at approximately
          the same speed as a computer with a nn-MHz 80486 (or Pentium-
          something) CPU.  Then "nn" (the number of MHz) must be a number
          between 0 and 5000.  A MHz value of 0 runs the computer as slow as
          is safe, and a MHz value that is at least as large as your computer
          is capable of will not Slow the computer Down at all.

          In testing with SLOWDOWN, I have discovered that the only thing
          that really affects Speed significantly (at least for DOS programs)
          on new computers is how many MHz the CPU is running at.  It really
          doesn't matter whether the CPU is an 80486 or the latest version of
          Pentium-something (though the AMD chips are quite a bit faster than
          the equivalent Intel chips).  If Intel made a 350-MHz 80486, it
          would run at almost exactly the same speed as a Pentium-2 running
          at 350-MHz (of course, Intel stopped making 80486's a long time
          before CPU speeds even got close to 350-MHz).  For CPU's previous
          to the 80486 (80386, 80286, 80186, 8086, or 8088), the type of CPU
          as well as the CPU MHz both affect the speed.  There is a
          comparison of some CPU Speeds you can see with the TABLE Option
          described below (page 13).



                       SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 7 of 44



     * /P:nn.nn
     * /Percent:nn.nn  /Pct:nn.nn

          This Option tells SLOWDOWN to run the computer at approximately
          Nn.nn% (PERCENT) of normal speed.  The Nn.nn must be a number
          between 0.00 and 100.00, and can include precision down the 1/100
          of a percent (up to two numerals after the decimal point).  For
          instance, the following are acceptable percentage values to use:

            0  10  00010.0  0.13  .13  50.4  75.04  100  99.99  100.00

          The following percentage values would cause errors:

             -1      Can't be less than 0
            100.01   Can't be more than 100
              0.345  Can't have more than 2 numerals after the decimal point

          A PERCENT of 0 slows the computer down as much as is safe, and a
          PERCENT of 100 does not Slow the computer Down at all.

     * /X [:speed]
     * /XTSpeed [:speed]  /XTSpd [:speed]  /XT [:speed]
     * /XSpeed [:speed]   /XSpd [:speed]

          This is sort of like two Options in one.  If you simply do the "/X"
          (or "/XT" or "XTSpeed" or ...), you are telling SLOWDOWN to run the
          computer at approximately the same speed as an IBM PC/XT (a
          computer with a 4.77-MHz 8088 CPU).

          If you enter the ":speed" part of the Option (for example,
          "SLOWDOWN /X:100"), you are telling SLOWDOWN to change how fast it
          thinks an XT is.  If there, the "speed" part of the Option must be
          a number between 0 and 65535, and is the number of Slowdown-Units
          (SU's) you want SLOWDOWN to assume an XT is.  See the section
          below, "HOW SLOWDOWN WORKS" (page 33), for a detailed explanation
          of Slowdown-Units.

          I have actually measured a computer with a 4.77-MHz 8088 CPU, and
          have found the Speed to be 12 SU's (this is also detailed in the
          TABLE Option below on page 13).  For whatever reason, you may not
          agree with this.  Perhaps, for some reason, on your computer, you
          think a Speed of 20 is more like what an XT is really like.  To
          change the SLOWDOWN XT-Speed to 20 Slowdown-Units, you would do a:

            SLOWDOWN /XT:20

          As long as SLOWDOWN is not UNINSTALLed from memory (see page 24),
          SLOWDOWN will continue to remember the XT-Speed that you told it.
          Then, when you tell SLOWDOWN to run the computer at the same Speed
          as an XT (either with the plain XT command-line Option or by using
          the Hot-Keys described below on page 28), SLOWDOWN will use the XT-
          Speed you told it to use, instead of using the default value of 12
          SU's.  See "THE SLOWDOWN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE" below (page 25) for
          details on how you can make the XT-Speed change truly "permanent",
          even if you UNINSTALL SLOWDOWN from memory.


          It's important to note that there are really two different Options
          described here.  One Option (the one with the ":speed" part) simply
          tells SLOWDOWN what the XT-Speed should be, but does not actually
          change the speed of the computer.  The other Option (the one
          without the ":speed" part) is the one that will actually change the
          speed of the computer.  If you want to have SLOWDOWN both change
          the XT-Speed and to start running the computer at that XT-Speed at
          the same time, you will need to enter both Options.  For example:

            SLOWDOWN /XTSpeed=20 /XTSpeed






                       SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 9 of 44



     * /A [:speed]
     * /ATSpeed [:speed]  /ATSpd [:speed]  /AT [:speed]
     * /ASpeed [:speed]   /ASpd [:speed]

          This Option is very similar to the XT Option described directly
          above (page 9).  However, the XT Option above is based on the IBM
          PC/XT (4.77-MHz 8088 CPU), while this AT Option is based on the IBM
          PC/AT (8-MHz 80286 CPU).  Read the XT Option above if you want full
          details on exactly how this Option works.

          This AT Option tells SLOWDOWN to run the computer the same Speed as
          an IBM PC/AT (with an 8-MHz 80286 CPU).  If you enter the ":speed"
          part of the Option, you are telling SLOWDOWN to use the Speed you
          give it (in SU's) as the AT-Speed, instead of using the default
          (measured) AT-Speed of 54 SU's.  "Speed" can be a number between 0
          and 65535.  Again, read the details of the XT Option (directly
          above, page 9), and replace "XT" with "AT" when appropriate.


     * /R [:speed]
     * /RememberSpeed [:speed]  /RememberSpd [:speed]  /Remember [:speed]
     * /RemSpeed [:speed]       /RemSpd [:speed]       /Rem [:speed]

          This Option is very similar to both the XT Option (above, page 9)
          and the AT Option (also above, page 10).  Read the XT Option above
          if you want full details on exactly how this Option works.

          While the XT and AT Options are based on specific models of
          computer (the IBM PC/XT and the IBM PC/AT, respectively), this
          REMEMBER Option can be based on anything you want it to be.  It is
          simply a particular Speed you want SLOWDOWN to REMEMBER for some
          reason, and want to easily have SLOWDOWN start running the computer
          at that Speed.  You can use SLOWDOWN's HOT-KEYS (see page 28 below)
          to "switch" the computer to the REMEMBER-Speed (and also to set a
          new REMEMBER-Speed), which is probably the best way to use the
          REMEMBER Option.  See the HOT-KEYS section below (page 28) for
          details on this.

          By default, the REMEMBER-Speed is set at 65535 Slowdown-Units,
          which means that it will not slow the computer down at all.  If you
          enter the ":speed" part of the Option, you are telling SLOWDOWN to
          use the Speed you give it (in SU's) as the REMEMBER-Speed, instead
          of using the default REMEMBER-Speed of 65535 SU's.  "Speed" must be
          a number between 0 and 65535.  Again, read the details of the XT
          Option (above, page 9), and replace "XT" with "REMEMBER-Speed" when
          appropriate.

     * /S:nn
     * /Speed:nn  /Spd:nn

     * /Slowdown-factor

          There are actually two Options described here, the SPEED Option
          (/S:nn, /Spd:nn, or /Speed:nn) and the SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Option
          (/Slowdown-factor).  Although they are in a sense "opposites" of
          each other, they are also very similar to each other.  Therefore,
          I'm going to describe them together.

          With the SPEED Option, you are telling SLOWDOWN how fast you want
          the computer to be (in Slowdown-Units or SU's) after it gets done
          Slowing the computer Down (and SLOWDOWN will calculate how much to
          Slow the computer Down to make that happen).  With the SLOWDOWN-
          FACTOR Option, you are telling SLOWDOWN how many SU's to Slow the
          computer Down by (and SLOWDOWN will leave however many SU's the
          computer has left for the other programs to use).

          The "nn" in the SPEED Option, and the "Slowdown-factor" in the
          SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Option, must be a number between 0 and 65535, and
          is the number of Slowdown-Units (SU's) to "leave" (in the SPEED
          Option) or to "waste" (in the SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Option).  In the
          SPEED Option, the larger the number of SU's, the faster the
          computer will run.  In the SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Option, the larger the
          number of SU's, the slower the computer will run.  A SPEED of 0
          SU's will slow the computer down as much as is safe, and a SPEED at
          least as large as the computer is capable of running will not Slow
          it Down at all.  A SLOWDOWN-FACTOR of 0 SU's will not Slow the
          computer Down at all, and a SLOWDOWN-FACTOR at least as large as
          your computer is capable of will Slow the computer Down as much as
          is safe.





















                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 11 of 44



          A SlowDown-Unit (SU) is something unique to SLOWDOWN, and is the
          method of measurement it uses internally both to calculate the
          Speed of the computer and to Slow the computer Down.  If you're
          interested, a more detailed description of SU's is given below in
          "HOW SLOWDOWN WORKS" (page 33).  There is also a CPU Speed Table
          below under the TABLE Option (page 13) that shows the measured
          Speed of several different computers (in SU's).  You can compare
          your computer to this TABLE to see how fast your computer really
          is.


          Whether it is better to use the SPEED Option or the SLOWDOWN-FACTOR
          Option depends on exactly what you're trying to accomplish.  If
          you're trying to make your computer "perform like" some other
          particular computer that you know the SPEED of, the SPEED Option is
          probably easier to use.  If you're just trying to "Slow the
          computer Down some", the SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Option may be easier to
          use.


          If you want your computer to run the same speed as some other
          particular type of computer (like a PC/XT or a PC/AT), it is
          generally easier to use one of the other "speed control" Options
          (MHZ, page 7, PERCENT, page 8, XT, page 9, or AT, page 10), instead
          of the SPEED or SLOWDOWN-FACTOR Options.  The SPEED and SLOWDOWN-
          FACTOR Options are really designed for "fine-tuning" SLOWDOWN for
          some special purpose (although it's entirely up to you exactly how
          you use SLOWDOWN).

          This Option shows you an on-line TABLE of CPU Speeds for different

          what SLOWDOWN uses to measure Speed) are not something you're

                 NOTE: Speed is measured in Slowdown-Units (SU's)

          If you want your computer to "look like" some other particular type
          of computer, pick an appropriate Speed from the Table (you may have
          to do a little bit of multiplication or division to get an exact
          fit).  For example, let's say you have a really fast computer.
          There is some particular program you have that is designed to run
          on a 12-MHz 80286 computer.  From the Table, you see that an 8-MHz
          80286 runs at a speed of 54 SU's.  A 12-MHz 80286 will run about
          (12)/(8) = 1.5 times as fast as an 8-MHz 80286, or an approximate
          Speed of (54)*(1.5) = 81 SU's.  To have your computer "look like" a
          12-MHz 80286, you could do the following:

            SLOWDOWN /Speed=81












                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 13 of 44



          The Speed measurements in the TABLE were taken by booting the
          measured computer with a "clean" DOS floppy disk (nothing in
          CONFIG.SYS and nothing in AUTOEXEC.BAT), and then running SLOWDOWN.
          If you use SLOWDOWN yourself to measure the Speed of a computer
          that is similar to one in the TABLE, you may find your actual
          measured Speed to be slightly different than the TABLE entry (but
          it should be very close).  In particular, every TSR you install
          (either with CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT) before running SLOWDOWN
          will cause the computer to Slow Down at least a little bit.  Trust
          me, the values in the TABLE are pretty accurate and you should not
          worry about trying to modify them (as I know some of you
          perfectionists will be tempted to do).


          If you have a really fast computer, and if you pay attention as you
          are using SLOWDOWN, you will notice that the Speed of your computer
          (as measured by SLOWDOWN) can vary from one time to the next.  For
          example, you can run SLOWDOWN once at get a measured computer Speed
          of 3000, and then run it again and get a measured Speed of 3002.
          This is due to the unpredictabile nature of how long it takes other
          background Applications (like other TSR's you have installed in
          memory) to do what they need to do.  When running "real" DOS (not
          running a DOS Box underneath Windows), the numbers usually only
          vary by 1 or 2.  Underneath Windows, though, the numbers can vary
          significantly.  They usually don't vary by more than about 5, but I
          have seen them vary by as much as several hundred.  This is because
          of the unpredictable nature of Windows running other programs
          (including just itself) in the background.

          Also, if you have a really fast computer, you will notice that some
          programs will not run smoothly if you try to slow the computer down
          too much.  In other words, some programs are "jerky" (some parts of
          the programs run too fast, some parts run OK, and some parts run
          too slow).  Not all programs are jerky (at least not so jerky that
          you can't use them), but some are.  Again, this is due to the
          unpredictabile nature of how long it takes to do any particular
          thing on the computer (newer computers don't do EVERYTHING faster
          than the old computers -- they only do some things faster).  The
          larger the discrepancy between the actual Speed of the Computer and
          the desired Speed, the more likely it is to be jerky.













                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 14 of 44



          Some computers also have a way where you can change the speed (the
          MHz) of the CPU.  With some computers, you will need to get into
          the BIOS Setup when you first turn the computer on (which means you
          will need to reboot).  Other computers have a physical switch on
          the computer case (usually labeled "Turbo").  Your computer may
          also have some sort of BIOS Hot-Key that lets you do it from the
          keyboard (the most common Hot-Keys I've seen are
          <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<Grey-> to have the CPU run slow, and
          <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<Grey+> to have the CPU run fast).  Sometimes slowing
          down the CPU Speed before you run SLOWDOWN can help things run
          smoother, and sometimes can even let you avoid using SLOWDOWN
          altogether.


          If anyone wants to, they can also send me information on more
          computers that I can add to the TABLE.  I do have a few
          stipulations on what you should send me, however.  First of all,
          the computer must be booted with "clean" DOS (nothing in CONFIG.SYS
          and nothing in AUTOEXEC.BAT).  Also, you should verify what your
          CPU Type and Speed really are with an external program (I
          personally use a free program called NSSI).  I also really only
          want information on CPU's that are significantly different than
          those already in the Table, or that for some reason show my
          conclusion that "the CPU MHz number is the only thing that really
          affects things very much" is incorrect.  I would definitely like
          some tests performed on 8086, 80186, 80286, 80386, Pentium,
          Pentium 3, Celeron, and non-Intel CPU's (like AMD, Cyrix, and NEC).


























                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 15 of 44



     There is an Option to run a single PROGRAM "slowly", after which
     SLOWDOWN will return the computer to normal Speed.


       {Program} [ProgramOptions]

          {Program} is the name of a single PROGRAM that you want SLOWDOWN to
          run "slowly", and [ProgramOptions] are the command-line Options
          that PROGRAM needs to operate correctly.  If you are using the
          PROGRAM Option, it MUST be the last Option on the command-line (any
          other SLOWDOWN command-line Options must come before it).  After
          PROGRAM is finished, SLOWDOWN will automatically return the
          computer to the Speed it was running before you started running
          PROGRAM.  For example:

            SLOWDOWN /MHz=100  EDIT C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT

          will slow your computer down to approximately the same speed as a
          100-Mhz 80486 computer, and then start running
          "EDIT C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT".  Note that the HOT-KEYS (described on page
          28) will still work in EDIT, allowing you to change Speeds while
          using EDIT -- the "/MHz=100" will simply set the Speed of the
          computer as EDIT is starting.  When you exit out of EDIT, SLOWDOWN
          will automatically return your computer to the Speed it was running
          before you started EDIT.

          {Program} must be the name of an executable file (one that ends in
          .COM, .EXE, or .BAT).  You do not need to put the .COM, .EXE. or
          .BAT extension as part of {Program}, however.  When DOS is deciding
          which program it will run, it uses a set of internal rules which
          will totally ignore the extension that you give it anyway.  I won't
          go into details about how DOS decides which program to run, but
          will tell you that it involves internal DOS commands, the current
          directory (folder), the PATH environment variable, and filename
          extensions (though not the extension that you give it).  You'll
          need to read a book or magazine article on DOS if you want to know
          the details.

          Although you don't need a filename extension, you may need to
          include a drive and path (for example, "C:\DOS\EDIT" instead of
          just "EDIT") as part of {Program}.  If you don't, DOS may either
          not be able to find the PROGRAM at all, or, worse yet, may run the
          wrong PROGRAM (you could have two different versions of "EDIT", for
          example, and not even know it).  SLOWDOWN uses DOS to run the
          PROGRAM, so all of the DOS rules about file names, PATHs, etc.,
          apply.







                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 16 of 44



          If you use this PROGRAM Option to run a single program "slowly",
          SLOWDOWN does not install itself permanently into memory as a TSR.
          That is, after PROGRAM is finished running, SLOWDOWN removes itself
          from memory and returns your computer to exactly the way it was
          before you started.  SLOWDOWN doesn't use a lot of memory when
          installed as a TSR (less than 2000 bytes), but by using the PROGRAM
          Option, you can be sure SLOWDOWN doesn't use ANY memory at all
          except when it is actually doing something.

          Note that it is also possible to both install SLOWDOWN as a TSR and
          to run a single program "slowly".  For instance, you could do the
          following:

            SLOWDOWN /MHz=50
            SLOWDOWN /MHz=25  PROGRAM1

          The first line installs SLOWDOWN as a TSR, and starts running the
          computer at the same Speed as a 50-MHz 80486 computer.  The second
          line will run PROGRAM1 (whatever that is) at an initial Speed of
          25-MHz.  After PROGRAM1 is done, the computer will automatically
          return to whatever Speed it was running before PROGRAM1 started (in
          this case, 50-MHz).  The SLOWDOWN TSR will continue to remain in
          memory (perhaps forever) even after PROGRAM1 has stopped.  If you
          want to permanently remove the SLOWDOWN TSR from memory for some
          reason, you need to use the UNINSTALL Option (page 24 below).


          You should not use the PROGRAM Option of SLOWDOWN to install
          another PROGRAM that is itself a TSR.  By definition, after a TSR
          is finished running (and has been "installed" into memory), it
          leaves part of itself behind in memory (it does not ever completely
          remove itself).  With the PROGRAM Option, SLOWDOWN completely
          removes itself from memory when it is done.  If PROGRAM is a TSR
          (which does not completely remove itself from memory when it is
          done), you can run into major problems.  In the best scenario,
          everything may work fine (though this scenario is highly unlikely).
          In the middle-of-the-road scenario, you will be leaving unusable
          "holes" in your memory, even though all of the programs may work
          like they're supposed to.  In the worst scenario, your computer
          will crash and burn.

          If, for some reason, you want to (or need to) use SLOWDOWN to
          install another Program that is a TSR, you should first install
          SLOWDOWN as a TSR (by NOT giving it a PROGRAM Option).  You can
          then either use HOT-KEYS (described on page 28) or command-line
          Options to have SLOWDOWN temporarily slow the computer down while
          the other TSR Program is installing.  After the other TSR is
          installed, you can return the computer back to normal Speed if you
          want (again, either with SLOWDOWN HOT-KEYS or command-line
          Options).



                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 17 of 44



          If you want to run several programs in a row "slowly" (instead of
          just a single PROGRAM), and have the computer automatically return
          to normal Speed after you are done, there are three different ways
          you can approach it.  All three approaches will involve you writing
          batch files, however.  Let's say you want to run three separate
          programs in a row, called Program1, Program2, and Program3.  You
          want to have the computer be Slowed Down to 10% of normal speed for
          all three programs, and you want the computer to return to normal
          speed after the three programs are done.  Here are some different
          batch files you could use to do it.

          This first example installs SLOWDOWN as a TSR, runs the three
          Programs, and then UNINSTALLs the SLOWDOWN TSR from memory:

            BATCH1.BAT:
              SLOWDOWN /Percent=10
              Program1
              Program2
              Program3
              SLOWDOWN /Uninstall

          This second example actually slows down each Program individually
          (using the SLOWDOWN PROGRAM Option three separate times).  Because
          it does this all in the same batch file, though, it will appear
          almost as though the computer is continuously running "slowly" the
          whole time:

            BATCH2.BAT:
              SLOWDOWN /Percent=10  Program1
              SLOWDOWN /Percent=10  Program2
              SLOWDOWN /Percent=10  Program3

          This last example actually uses two separate batch files, and one
          batch file calls (runs) the other one:

            BATCH3A.BAT:
              SLOWDOWN /Percent=10  BATCH3B

            BATCH3B.BAT:
              Program1
              Program2
              Program3











                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 18 of 44



          Another thing to keep in mind when using the PROGRAM Option is that
          you will not know what the ERRORLEVEL (return code) of the PROGRAM
          you are running is.  ERRORLEVEL's are returned by all DOS programs
          after they execute.  Their main purpose is to allow DOS batch files
          to "automatically" make decisions about what to do next based on
          whether the previous Program worked properly or not.  However, the
          ERRORLEVEL of the SLOWDOWN'd PROGRAM is not returned when you use
          the PROGRAM Option with SLOWDOWN -- what is returned is the
          SLOWDOWN ERRORLEVEL (see "ERRORLEVELS" below on page 27).  Let's
          compare the following two excerpts from batch files designed to run
          PROGRAM1 "slowly", and then remove SLOWDOWN from memory:

          BATCH1.BAT:
              SLOWDOWN /AT
              PROGRAM1
              IF NOT ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO NoError
                REM Handle the PROGRAM1 Error Here
            :NoError
              SLOWDOWN /Uninstall
                REM This could be "SLOWDOWN /0", if you don't
                REM   want to completely remove SLOWDOWN from memory.

          BATCH2.BAT:
            SLOWDOWN /AT PROGRAM1
              REM Can't do a PROGRAM1 ERRORLEVEL check Here!

          As you can see by the REMark lines, with the first batch file
          (BATCH1.BAT), you can do any sort of ERRORLEVEL stuff related to
          PROGRAM1 you want.  In the second example (BATCH2.BAT), the
          ERRORLEVELs from PROGRAM1 are "lost", and you can't use them to do
          any sort of "smart" Batch file programming.  If you don't need or
          don't care about or don't understand ERRORLEVELs, then it doesn't
          matter which method you use to run PROGRAM1.  If the PROGRAM1
          ERRORORLEVELs matter to you for some reason, then you must install
          SLOWDOWN as a TSR, and then Uninstall it after PROGRAM1 is finished
          (look at BATCH1.BAT).

          When using the PROGRAM Option, SLOWDOWN requires quite a bit more
          memory than it does as a TSR.  When using the PROGRAM Option,
          SLOWDOWN itself requires about 3200 bytes (3.2K) of memory.  In
          addition, when using the PROGRAM Option, SLOWDOWN loads a temporary
          copy of the DOS Command Shell (usually, this is COMMAND.COM).  The
          memory required by the DOS Command Shell is normally somewhere
          between 3K and 8K (exactly how big it is depends on which version
          of DOS you're using and how you have DOS configured).  Therefore,
          the total amount of memory required by SLOWDOWN when using the
          PROGRAM Option will usually be somewhere between 6K and 11K (a lot
          more than the 2K required by SLOWDOWN when it is installed as a
          TSR).  There is a more detailed discussion of this below in the
          "THE DOS EXEC FUNCTION AND COMMAND.COM" (page 36), if you're
          interested.


                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 19 of 44



     There are Options to configure and control the Hot-Keys.


     * /K:shift-mask
     * /HotKeyShiftMask:shift-mask  /HotKeySftMask:shift-mask
     * /HotKeyMask:shift-mask       /HotKey:shift-mask
     * /KeyShiftMask:shift-mask     /KeySftMask:shift-mask
     * /KeyMask:shift-mask          /Key:shift-mask
     * /ShiftMask:shift-mask        /SftMask:shift-mask

          This Option is used to set the SHIFT-MASK for the SLOWDOWN Hot-
          Keys.  These Hot-Keys allow you to control the speed of the
          computer with the keyboard, even while you are in the middle of
          another program.  There are several keys on the keyboard that
          SLOWDOWN uses to do this, which are described more completely in
          the "HOT-KEYS" section below (page 28).

          It actually takes three "pieces" for the Hot-Keys to work, though.
          There are the Hot-Keys themselves (described in the "HOT-KEYS"
          section below, page 28), the ENABLE/DISABLE Options described
          directly below (page 22), and the SHIFT-MASK (discussed right
          here).  The SHIFT-MASK is some combination of the <Shift>, <Ctrl>,
          and <Alt> keys that must be already be pressed before you press the
          Hot-Key.  The default SHIFT-MASK that SLOWDOWN uses is
          <Ctrl>-<Alt>.  To change the SLOWDOWN SHIFT-MASK, you give SLOWDOWN
          (as the "shift-mask" part of the Option) a list of shift-keys
          (Shift, Ctrl, or Alt) that you would like it to use, separated by
          dashes ("-").

          For example, to change the SHIFT-MASK from whatever it was before
          to <Shift>-<Alt>, you could do the following:

            SLOWDOWN /ShiftMask = Shift-Alt

          The SHIFT-MASK can be any combination of 0, 1, 2, or all 3 shift-
          keys, and the order doesn't matter ("Shift-Alt" is the same as
          "Alt-Shift", etc.).  Here are the words you can use to describe
          each of the shift-keys in the "shift-mask" part of the Option:

            Shift  Sft  S
            Control  Cntrl  Cntl  Ctrl  Ctl  C  Strg  Stg
            Alt  AltGr  A











                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 20 of 44



          You can also have the SHIFT-MASK be "nothing" (no shift-keys at
          all) by using one of the following as the "shift-mask":

            0  Empty  Nada  No  None  Nothing  Nil  Null

          Although SLOWDOWN will let you set the SHIFT-MASK to "Nothing", or
          to a simple "Shift" key, under normal circumstances you do not want
          to do this.  It can cause you a great amount of confusion and
          weeping, since you will probably think your keyboard is broken
          (trust me -- I went through this more than once as I was testing
          SLOWDOWN, and it was not at all fun).


          Here are some "shift-mask" Options that would be OK:

            S-C-A  Sft-Ctl-Alt  Control  Alt-Cntrl  None

          These "shift-mask" Options would generate error messages:

            Ctrl-Ctrl    Can only use the same shift-key once
            None-Shift   The None shift-mask must be by itself
            Ctrl Alt     Must put a dash ("-") between each shift-key


          Again, exactly what the Hot-Keys are and how to use them is
          discussed in detail below in the "HOT-KEYS" section (page 28).
          Read that section if you want to know more.


























                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 21 of 44



     * /E
     * /EnableHotKeys  /EnableKeys  /Enable  /On

     * /D
     * /DisableHotKeys  /DisableKeys  /Disable  /Off

          These Options allow you to ENABLE (turn on) or DISABLE (turn off)
          the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys.  Exactly what the Hot-Keys are and what they
          do is described below in the "HOT-KEYS" section (page 28).  In
          addition, the SHIFT-MASK Option discussed directly above (page 20)
          discusses a second aspect of the Hot-Keys.  These ENABLE and
          DISABLE Options control the third and final aspect of getting the
          SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys to work.

          By default, the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys are ENABLEd.  This means that, by
          default, if you press one of the appropriate SHIFT-MASK and Hot-Key
          combinations, SLOWDOWN will change the Speed of the computer
          "on-the-fly" even if you are in the middle of another program.  If
          you want to turn the Hot-Keys completely off, you will need to
          DISABLE them (by giving SLOWDOWN the DISABLE Option).


          Under normal circumstances, it is best to leave the Hot-Keys
          ENABLEd all the time, especially if you have the SHIFT-MASK set to
          something relatively obscure (like the default SHIFT-MASK of
          <Ctrl>-<Alt>).  If the SHIFT-MASK is "uncommon", it is very
          unlikely that you can accidentally change the Speed of your
          computer.

          The only reason you might want to DISABLE the Hot-Keys is if, for
          some reason, you don't want to be able to change the Speed of the
          computer "on-the-fly", and you are also afraid, for some reason,
          that you will accidentally type a SLOWDOWN Hot-Key and not realize
          that you did it.  As long as you realized that the Speed of the
          computer has changed, even if you did it by accident, you could
          easily "undo" the change with another Hot-Key.

          Again, read the "HOT-KEYS" section below (page 28) if you want
          details on exacly what the Hot-Keys are and what they do.














                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 22 of 44



     There are also some miscellaneous (housekeeping) Options.
     */Q
     */Quiet /ShutUp

     * /V
     * /Verbose /Talk

          These Options are complements of each other.  With the VERBOSE
          Option selected, when you type "SLOWDOWN {Options}" at the command-
          line, SLOWDOWN provides you with several lines of information about
          how SLOWDOWN is currently configured (information such as the Speed
          of your computer and the current status of the SHIFT-MASK).
          Exactly what SLOWDOWN tells you depends on several factors, so I
          won't go into details (you can view the information for yourself).
          However, this information does take up several lines of your
          screen, and can in fact clutter up your screen with a lot of stuff
          you may not normally care to see.

          With the QUIET Option selected, SLOWDOWN does not display any of
          this information.  Your screen is much less cluttered, but it is
          also not telling you some things that you may want to know about
          what SLOWDOWN is doing (you are "running blind").  Note that
          SLOWDOWN will always print error messages to the screen, even if
          the QUIET Option is set.  The QUIET Option only prevents
          configuration information from being displayed, not error
          information.

          The most common way to use the QUIET and VERBOSE Options is with
          the SLOWDOWN Environment variable (see "THE SLOWDOWN ENVIRONMENT
          VARIABLE" below on page 25).  If you want SLOWDOWN to normally be
          QUIET, set the QUIET Option in the SLOWDOWN Environment variable.
          If you then decide, for some reason, that you want to temporarily
          override the QUIET Option so SLOWDOWN will show you what it is
          doing, you can enter the VERBOSE Option on the command-line.  Read
          "THE SLOWDOWN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE" section below (page 25) for
          more details.

          The default is for SLOWDOWN to be VERBOSE.

     * /U
     * /Uninstall /Remove /Out

          This will permanently UNINSTALL (or at least try to UNINSTALL)
          SLOWDOWN from memory, if it was installed as a TSR (if it was not
          installed with the PROGRAM Option described above, page 16).  If
          all you are trying to do is stop Slowing the computer Down, you can
          just use an appropriate speed-control Option (such as
          "SLOWDOWN /0", "SLOWDOWN /Speed=65535", "SLOWDOWN /Percent=100",
          or "SLOWDOWN /MHz=5000").  This UNINSTALL Option will stop Slowing
          the computer Down just like one of the speed-control Options, but
          will also attempt to remove the SLOWDOWN TSR from memory.  This
          will free up about 2000 bytes of memory for your machine to use on
          other things, and will also permanently Disable (remove from
          memory) the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys.


     * /?
       /H /Help

          This Option will pull up a HELP screen which gives a quick summary
          of the possible command-line Options for SLOWDOWN.  This will also
          give you a quick summary of how fast SLOWDOWN thinks your computer
          is, without actually Slowing the computer Down, or without
          installing itself into memory.

     THE SLOWDOWN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
     อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN also looks for an Environment variable called SLOWDOWN.  This
     variable can contain some of the standard command-line Options listed
     starting above on page 6.  The Options it CANNOT contain are the Options
     that directly change the speed of the computer (/MHz:nn, /Percent:nn.nn,
     /Speed:nn, /Slowdown-Factor, /XT, /AT, or /Remember), or the PROGRAM
     Option.  The SLOWDOWN Environment variable CAN contain any of the other
     Options detailed above (/XT:speed, /AT:speed, /Remember:speed, /Table,
     /ShiftMask:shift-mask, /Enable, /Disable, /Quiet, /Verbose, /Uninstall,
     or /Help).

     SLOWDOWN reads the Options from the SLOWDOWN Environment variable before
     it reads the Options from the DOS command-line.  Any Options you have in
     the SLOWDOWN Environment variable act like they are entered at the
     beginning of each command-line, and effectively become your "default"
     settings.  Because Options entered later on the command-line take
     precedence over Options entered earlier on the command-line, though, you
     can easily override the "default" settings contained in the Environment
     variable any time you want.  For example, let's say you set the SLOWDOWN
     Environment variable as follows:

       SET SLOWDOWN=/ShiftMask:Shift-Alt /XTSpeed:20

     This would SET the "default" SLOWDOWN SHIFT-MASK to <Shift>-<Alt>, and
     also SET the "default" XT-Speed to 20 Slowdown-Units.  Let's say you
     then ran SLOWDOWN as follows from the command-line (or a batch file):

       SLOWDOWN /ShiftMask:Ctrl-Alt

     The combination of the Environment variable and the command-line Options
     would act as if you had done this:

       SLOWDOWN /ShiftMask:Shift-Alt /XTSpeed:20 /ShiftMask:Ctrl-Alt

     You have overridden the "default" SHIFT-MASK (<Shift>-<Alt>) with a
     "temporary" SHIFT-MASK (<Ctrl>-<Alt>).  SLOWDOWN will continue to use
     the "temporary" SHIFT-MASK until you run SLOWDOWN at the command-line
     again, when it will start using the "default" SHIFT-MASK from the
     Environment variable again.  Also, Environment variables are "permanent"
     (they continue to be remembered by the computer until they are reset or
     until DOS stops running).  This means that even if you UNINSTALL
     SLOWDOWN from memory, SLOWDOWN will still be able to know about the
     "default" settings next time you run it.








                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 25 of 44



     Although you can SET Environment variables at any time from the DOS
     command-line (or from batch files), it is usually better to SET them in
     your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  That way, they are truly "permanent", and will
     automatically be there every time you start your computer.  Another
     thing you need to know about Environment variables is that, with some
     versions of DOS, an Environment variable cannot contain an equals ("=").
     In the SLOWDOWN Options, Equals ("=") and Colon (":") are
     interchangeable.  You should try to remember to use ":" when setting
     Environment variables, but can either use ":" or "=" on the command-
     line.  For instance, let's compare the following two lines which SET the
     SLOWDOWN Environment variable:

       SET SLOWDOWN= /ATSpeed = 100
       SET SLOWDOWN= /ATSpeed : 100

     The first line may not work on some computers, but it would on others.
     The second line will work on all computers.


     If you do not have the QUIET Option set (above, page 23), or temporarily
     override the QUIET Option with the VERBOSE Option (also above on page
     23), SLOWDOWN will show you what the SLOWDOWN Environment variable is
     set to every time you run it.  If SLOWDOWN is doing something that you
     don't expect it to, it could be because of a setting you put in your
     Environment variable and forgot was there.  When troubleshooting, make
     sure you look at the SLOWDOWN Environment variable -- that could be
     where the problem is.

     If you don't know what an Environment is, or what it is used for, I
     suggest you read about it in your favorite DOS book.

     ERRORLEVELS
     อออออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN sets the following ERRORLEVELs after it executes, to give you
     an indication of what happened.  If you don't understand the purpose or
     value of ERRORLEVELs, I suggest you read about them in your DOS manual.

     HOT-KEYS
     ออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN has several Hot-Keys that you can use to control and change the
     speed of the computer "on-the-fly", even while you are in the middle of
     another program.  There are some command-line Options that also control
     certain aspects of how the Hot-Keys work (specifically, the SHIFT-MASK
     Option on page 20 and the ENABLE/DISABLE Options on page 22).  Read the
     details about those Options if you want more information.

     In the following table, though, we will assume that the SHIFT-MASK is
     set at the default value of <Control>-<Alt> (see page 20), and that the
     Hot-Keys are ENABLEd (see page 22).  Here are the Hot-Keys, and what
     they will do if you press them:

       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<`>     Run at 0% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:0)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<1>     Run at 10% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:10)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<2>     Run at 20% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:20)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<3>     Run at 30% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:30)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<4>     Run at 40% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:40)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<5>     Run at 50% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:50)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<6>     Run at 60% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:60)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<7>     Run at 70% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:70)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<8>     Run at 80% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:80)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<9>     Run at 90% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:90)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<0>     Run at 100% of normal Speed  (like /Pct:100)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<->     Lower the computer speed by one Slowdown-Unit
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<=>     Increase the computer speed by one Slowdown-Unit
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<BkSp>  Lower the computer speed by approximately 1%
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<Tab>   Increase the computer speed by approximately 1%
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<X>     Run at XT-Speed  (like /XT)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<A>     Run at AT-Speed  (like /AT)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<R>     Run at the REMEMBER-Speed  (like /Remember)
       <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<S>     Store the current Speed as the REMEMBER-speed

     If the SHIFT-MASK is something other than <Ctrl>-<Alt>, you should
     replace the "<Ctrl>-<Alt>" parts of the table with the appropriate
     SHIFT-MASK.  If the Hot-Keys are DISABLED (see page 22), then pressing
     the Hot-Keys will, of course, not do anything at all.

     When you press one of the Hot-Keys (causing SLOWDOWN to do something to
     the Speed of the Computer), SLOWDOWN also beeps at you.  The frequency
     (or pitch) of the beep corresponds to the current speed of the computer.
     A low-frequency beep indicates the computer is running slowly (such as
     when you press <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<`>), and a high-frequency beep indicates
     the computer is running quickly (such as when you press
     <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<0>).






                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 28 of 44



     It is also possible that when you try to change the speed of the
     computer with a Hot-Key, SLOWDOWN will not change the speed of the
     computer at all.  If SCANCODE is not sure how fast your computer is when
     you press a Hot-Key, it will simply beep at you twice (and not change
     the computer speed).  SCANCODE will only do this under certain
     circumstances if you are using Microsoft Windows.  It revolves around
     the fact that "real" DOS is several times faster than a DOS box running
     underneath Windows, and the details are discussed below under "SLOWDOWN
     AND WINDOWS" (page 30).


     Also note that the Hot-Keys that are numbers (<1>, <2>, etc.) are the
     number keys along the top row of the keyboard, NOT on the NumberPad on
     the right side of the keyboard.  In addition, the descriptions given for
     the Hot-Keys are only accurate for a standard United States English
     keyboard.  If you use any other kind of keyboard, the descriptions may
     not be accurate (the Hot-Keys are determined by the physical location of
     the keys on the keyboard, not on how the keys are labeled).


     There may also be times when you're in the middle of another program and
     the Hot-Keys don't do anything (they don't beep at you and they don't
     change the speed of the computer).  This happens when the other program
     completely "takes over" the keyboard and doesn't allow any other program
     (like SLOWDOWN) to use the keyboard at the same time (Windows is one
     program that completely takes over the keyboard like this).  If you
     press a keystroke that the program doesn't understand (like one of
     SLOWDOWN's Hot-Keys), the program should assume that there might be a
     TSR that does understand the keystroke.  Unfortunately, not all programs
     do what I think they should.

     You will not be able to use the Hot-Keys in a program that completely
     takes over the keyboard like this.  Instead, you will have to set the
     correct computer Speed BEFORE the program starts (usually, the best way
     to do that is with a batch file).

     SLOWDOWN AND WINDOWS
     ออออออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN is a DOS program, and is designed to work with DOS programs.
     Nearly all versions of Windows are also DOS programs, even though
     Microsoft would like you to believe otherwise.  Even though Windows is a
     DOS program, though, SLOWDOWN will not Slow Down Windows or Windows-
     native Applications.  SLOWDOWN could do this (older versions of SLOWDOWN
     did), but I chose to remove that capability from this version of
     SLOWDOWN.  Windows is more than slow enough already without needing any
     extra help, and Windows will crash the computer a lot if you try and
     Slow things Down too much.

     However, you can use Windows as a DOS Task-Switcher.  You can run
     several DOS applications at the same time underneath Windows, and use
     Windows to switch between them.  Windows puts each DOS application in a
     separate DOS box, and you can use SLOWDOWN to Slow Down the DOS boxes
     that run underneath Windows.  In fact, SLOWDOWN will allow you to have
     each separate DOS box underneath Windows running at a separate SLOWDOWN
     speed than all of the other DOS boxes.  Let's talk a little bit about
     how DOS Boxes work.

     If you open more than one DOS Box underneath Windows, they are almost
     totally isolated from each other.  Anything that is done to the memory
     of one DOS Box can't be seen by any of the other DOS boxes.  For
     example, if you load SLOWDOWN into memory in one DOS Box, it does not
     affect any of the other DOS Boxes that might be running at the same
     time.  Each DOS box can have it's own independent copy of SLOWDOWN
     loaded into memory, and they will not affect or interfere with each
     other.

     However, anything you do to the memory of the computer BEFORE you start
     Windows (such as a installing SLOWDOWN with your AUTOEXEC.BAT file) is
     automatically available to all DOS Boxes that Windows may open up after
     it starts.  Windows has no choice but to "copy" what was there before it
     started because, as was stated before, Windows is itself nothing more
     than a large, slow DOS program.  It has to work with DOS programs (TSR's
     like SLOWDOWN) that were installed before it was.

     What SLOWDOWN is able to do (if you want it to) is to load a single copy
     of SLOWDOWN into memory (before Windows starts), and also to have each
     separate DOS Box running at a separate SLOWDOWN speed.  The single copy
     of SLOWDOWN (installed before Windows was started) will automatically
     change speeds appropriately as you switch between the different DOS
     boxes.  This can make it seem as if you have several different copies of
     SLOWDOWN running at the same time, even though there is really only one.
     SLOWDOWN will automatically keep track of and switch between 16
     different DOS Boxes underneath Windows.





                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 30 of 44



     Note that this Task-Switching capability of SLOWDOWN is only used if you
     install SLOWDOWN into memory before you start Windows (such as if you
     put a "SLOWDOWN" line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file).  If you do this,
     SLOWDOWN (including the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys) will be automatically
     accessible in all DOS Boxes that you start underneath Windows.  The
     other choice is to install SLOWDOWN only inside the DOS Boxes that will
     actually need SLOWDOWN, but, in my opinion, that is more complicated and
     more confusing.

     Windows is not the only DOS Task-Switching program there is.  Other
     Task-Switchers include DesqView, Software Carousel, and the DOSSHELL
     program that comes with later versions of DOS (to name a few).  The
     Task-Switching capability of SLOWDOWN will only work in Windows,
     however.  If a non-Windows Task-Switching program is used, you will
     probably want to load SLOWDOWN individually in each DOS box underneath
     the Task-Switcher.  If you try to load SLOWDOWN before you load the
     Task-Switcher, SLOWDOWN won't be able to "isolate" the DOS Boxes from
     each other (and this will cause you a lot of headaches).


     Another thing to keep in mind is that "real" DOS is a LOT faster than a
     DOS Box underneath Windows.  If you actually do a comparison of the two
     with SLOWDOWN, you will see that "real" DOS is AT LEAST twice as fast as
     a Windows DOS box on the same computer.  The difference in speed is so
     significant that you need to take some special precautions when using
     SLOWDOWN with Windows.

     Let's say you install SLOWDOWN before you start Windows, and when you
     do, SLOWDOWN says the maximum SPEED of your computer is 2400 Slowdown-
     Units (SU's).  Then you start Windows, and start a DOS Box underneath
     Windows, and run SLOWDOWN again.  Let's say SLOWDOWN now tells you the
     Maximum SPEED of your computer is 800 Slowdown-Units (1/3 as fast as it
     was before you installed Windows).  When you ran SLOWDOWN the second
     time (inside the DOS box), SLOWDOWN updated itself with the new Maximum
     SPEED of the computer (now only 800 Slowdown-Units, because it is
     running in a DOS Box underneath Windows).  SLOWDOWN will continue to
     work properly in all DOS Boxes until you exit from Windows (and the
     computer will automatically speed up again).

     Let's go through another scenario.  You do the same things as before, up
     to the point where you run SLOWDOWN the second time (you install
     SLOWDOWN, start Windows, and start a DOS Box underneath Windows).
     Instead of running SLOWDOWN a second time, though, you just try to
     change the speed of the computer with one of the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys,
     <Ctrl>-<Alt>-<1> (which is supposed to start running the computer at 10%
     of "Normal" Speed).  The problem is, "Normal" Speed now is only 800
     SU's, but SLOWDOWN still thinks it is 2400 SU's.  This could cause your
     computer to crash (SLOWDOWN will try to Slow Down your computer more
     than it is safe to do).




                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 31 of 44



     While SLOWDOWN can automatically tell whether or not Windows is running,
     it cannot automatically tell exactly how much Windows has Slowed Down
     the DOS Boxes that run underneath it.  If you install SLOWDOWN before
     you run Windows, and don't update SLOWDOWN (by running SLOWDOWN from the
     command-line inside at least one DOS Box), SLOWDOWN will ignore any Hot-
     Key requests you try to perform.  Instead of changing the Speed of the
     computer, SLOWDOWN will instead simply beep at you twice (indicating an
     problem).  If you want the Hot-Keys to work correctly, you need to make
     sure you run SCANCODE at least once from a DOS Box after Windows has
     started.

     If you quit Windows and start running DOS again (which you can't
     directly do with Windows 9x), or "Restart in MS-DOS Mode" (in Windows
     9x), the opposite problem happens.  DOS automatically starts running
     several times faster than it did while Windows was running.  However,
     SLOWDOWN can handle this situation automatically.  It remembers how fast
     the computer was before Windows started, and will automatically convert
     everything back to what it needs to be for "real" DOS again.


     In summary, SLOWDOWN will not Slow Down Windows directly, but can be
     used to Slow Down DOS Boxes underneath Windows.  Each DOS Box can be
     running at a different SLOWDOWN Speed.  You can either load a separate
     copy of SLOWDOWN in each DOS Box, or load a single copy of SLOWDOWN
     before Windows starts (such as with your AUTOEXEC.BAT file).  If you
     load SLOWDOWN before Windows starts, you will also need to run SLOWDOWN
     from the command-line at least once inside a DOS Box before SLOWDOWN
     will work correctly.

     HOW SLOWDOWN WORKS
     ออออออออออออออออออ

     Every "slowdown" type of program I've seen works essentially the same
     way, and SLOWDOWN is no exception (although I have tried some other
     methods, none have worked as flexibly or as reliably as this method).

     SLOWDOWN ties itself to the timer interrupt, which occurs approximately
     18 times per second on a PC.  The timer interrupt is always happening as
     long as your computer is turned on, even if the computer isn't "doing
     anything".  Each time a timer tick happens, SLOWDOWN wastes time by
     doing a series of "do-nothing" loops (a do-nothing loop is called a
     Slowdown-Unit or an SU).  Each Slowdown-Unit is a complicated and
     time-consuming set of things for the CPU (Central Processing Unit) to
     do, but doesn't provide any useful output -- it just wastes time (sounds
     a lot like Windows, doesn't it?).  Because SLOWDOWN is constantly
     wasting time (in the background) whenever there is a timer tick, a
     normal program (running in the foreground) is unable to get access to
     the CPU (your computer's "brain") as much as it normally does.  This
     makes the computer appear to run more slowly.


     In the Options you use to tell SLOWDOWN how fast (or how slow) you want
     the computer to run, you are telling SLOWDOWN (either directly or
     indirectly) how many Slowdown-Units (do-nothing loops) you want it to do
     each time there is a timer tick.  To calculate how fast your computer is
     compared to an XT or an AT or an 80486 computer, SLOWDOWN counts how
     many Slowdown-Units your computer can continuously do in one timer tick.
     SLOWDOWN knows that an XT (4.77-MHz 8088) can do approximately 12
     Slowdown-Units in one timer tick, an AT (8-MHz 80286) can do about 54
     SU's, and a 75-MHz 80486 can do about 889 SU's.  Because SLOWDOWN uses
     the exact same method (Slowdown-Units) to measure the Speed as it does
     to Slow Down the computer, it can simulate pretty accurately the Speed
     of almost any computer.  Note, though, that SLOWDOWN attempts to
     simulate a particular CPU speed, and the CPU speed is NOT the only thing
     that controls how fast a computer performs (though it is usually the
     main thing).

     For example, to simulate an XT, SLOWDOWN needs to waste some time each
     timer tick.  How much time?  Well, let's assume the maximum Speed of
     your computer is 120 Slowdown-Units (SU's).  SLOWDOWN needs to leave
     enough time for your computer to do the equivalent of 12 "do-nothing"
     loops each timer tick, so SLOWDOWN will "waste" 108 (120-12) SU's each
     timer tick.  This will leave 12 SU's worth of time for your computer to
     run other programs.  To simulate an AT (whose Speed is 54 SU's),
     SLOWDOWN will "waste" 66 (120-54) SU's each timer tick.  The maximum
     Slowdown-Factor SLOWDOWN would let you use is 120.  A Slowdown-Factor of
     120 would Slow the computer Down enough that it would be very
     frustrating to use, but should not stop the computer completely.




                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 33 of 44



     No "slowdown" or Benchmark program can do a perfect job of telling you
     exactly how fast your computer will run any particular program.  Suppose
     you have a Benchmark program (or a salesman) tell you your computer is
     50 times faster than an AT.  That doesn't mean every program you have
     will run 50 times faster on your computer than it will on an AT.  Some
     programs will run 50 times faster, but some may run only about 10 times
     faster, some may run at about the same speed, some may actually run
     slower, and some may not run at all.  It all depends on how the program
     is written and what the program is supposed to do.

     I'm telling you this because the default Speeds SLOWDOWN uses to
     simulate XT's and AT's will not always work correctly - you may have to
     experiment with each program (the SLOWDOWN Hot-Keys can help you "fine-
     tune" things).  If your program doesn't do anything too weird,
     SLOWDOWN's default values should work pretty well.  If you find values
     other than the defaults work better for a particular program, for
     heaven's sake write yourself a Batch file to automate the process for
     you the next time.

     One thing SLOWDOWN (and every other "slowdown" program I've seen)
     doesn't do well is sound.  The way a PC generates sounds through its
     speaker is not very sophisticated and not very controllable, and
     sometimes SLOWDOWN has a hard time dealing with it.  It just depends on
     how the program is written.  If the funky sounds or the extremely long
     beeps bother you, and the program has the option to turn off the sound,
     you may want to do just that.



























                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 34 of 44



     I also want to point out one other thing here.  There are some other
     "slowdown" programs out there that are pretty similar to SLOWDOWN, but
     they use a different "timer tick" than SLOWDOWN (they use Software
     Interrupt 70h, while SLOWDOWN uses Interrupt 08h).  They do this because
     Interrupt 70h can occur much more often than Interrupt 08h (nearly
     10,000 times per second, compared to only 18 times per second for
     Interrupt 08h).  This allows them to be "smoother" (sometimes programs
     are "jerky" when they are running with SLOWDOWN).

     I have experimented with Interrupt 70h, and while things can be
     "smoother" than with Interrupt 08h, there are some severe problems with
     Interrupt 70h.  First of all, the computer needs to have at least an
     80286 CPU (the "extra" timer tick related to Interrupt 70h does not
     exist on computers with 8088 CPU's).  I know computers with 8088 CPU's
     are rare nowadays (but they are not extinct -- I still have one), and
     ALL programs (not just "slowdown" programs) should work on ALL computers
     (in my opinion).

     The other (bigger) problem with Interrupt 70h is that there are a lot of
     programs it simply doesn't work with (including Windows).  These
     programs use Interrupt 70h themselves, and "override" anything that a
     "slowdown" program might try to do with the Interrupt.  Interrupt 08h is
     a system-level interrupt that is required for the computer to run, and
     it can NEVER be prevented from working by ANY program (not even
     Windows).

     If your computer doesn't have an 8088 CPU (which it probably doesn't),
     and your programs are too "jerky" when using SLOWDOWN, you might want to
     try one of the "slowdown" programs that use Interrupt 70h instead of
     using SLOWDOWN.  Just keep in mind that it won't always work correctly,
     or maybe won't even work at all.  It definitely will not work with
     Windows (including DOS Boxes underneath Windows).

     THE DOS EXEC FUNCTION AND COMMAND.COM
     อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     When you use the PROGRAM Option (page 16) to have SLOWDOWN execute a
     single Program (slowly), it uses a function in DOS called EXEC.  The
     EXEC function allows one program (SLOWDOWN) to call (run) another
     program (which is called the "Child program").  The Child program that
     SLOWDOWN calls is always COMMAND.COM, or whatever the COMSPEC
     environment variable is set to (COMMAND.COM is called the "DOS Shell").

     If you type a PROGRAM name at the end of the SLOWDOWN command line
     (telling SLOWDOWN to execute just one particular PROGRAM slowly),
     SLOWDOWN Slows Down the computer, and then EXEC's a "COMMAND /C {Program
     with Options}".  When the PROGRAM is finished (actually, when
     COMMAND.COM is finished), SLOWDOWN returns the computer to the Speed it
     was running before it did the EXEC.

     It would also be possible for SLOWDOWN to EXEC the PROGRAM directly
     (which is what some other "slowdown" programs do), instead of using
     COMMAND.COM as a "middleman".  The reason SLOWDOWN EXEC's the DOS Shell
     instead of directly EXEC'ing the PROGRAM is three-fold.  First of all,
     being in a DOS Shell is the only way you can execute a Batch file.  You
     cannot EXEC a Batch file directly - you can only EXEC a .COM or .EXE
     file.  Batch files are far too useful and prevalent to not allow
     SLOWDOWN to work with them.

     Secondly, a DOS Shell is the only way to execute internal DOS commands
     (COPY, DEL, DIR, SET, IF, FOR, etc.).  These internal commands are built
     inside the inner workings of the DOS Shell, and are impossible to EXEC
     directly.  As with Batch files, internal commands are far too useful to
     not allow SLOWDOWN to work with them.

     Lastly, using the DOS Shell allows all of your PATH's, file
     redirections, etc. to remain in full use.  The DOS Shell already knows
     how to use the PATH to find executable files, how to edit command line
     arguments, etc.  If SLOWDOWN didn't use the DOS Shell to handle these
     details, SLOWDOWN would become much more complicated and take up much
     more memory.  As it is, SLOWDOWN uses about 3.2K of memory, plus
     whatever COMMAND.COM uses (usually around 3-8k).














                      SLOWDOWN 2.00            Page 36 of 44



     Enough with the good things about EXEC and COMMAND.COM.  There is one
     minor "gotcha" that you need to be concerned about when using SLOWDOWN
     to EXEC a Batch file.  When the DOS EXEC function calls a Child program,
     it gives the Child a copy of the current Environment to use.  Instead of
     giving it a copy of the entire Environment, however, it only gives it a
     copy that is barely big enough to hold the current state of the
     Environment.  There is no extra space given to add more Environment
     variables to the list.

     If the Batch file you're EXEC'ing with SLOWDOWN tries to SET (create)
     any new Environment variables, you may get an "Out of Environment Space"
     error message.  There's probably a good reason the Batch file is trying
     to change the Environment variable, and will probably not work correctly
     if it can't SET it.  The only Batch files you sometimes have problems
     getting to work with SLOWDOWN are those that try to SET new Environment
     variables.  Batch files that don't try to increase the size of the
     Environment should work just fine.

     THE IBM INTERRUPT SHARING PROTOCOL
     ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     As of version 2.00, SLOWDOWN implements something called the "IBM
     Interrupt Sharing Protocol".  The details of the Protocol are pretty
     technical, and I won't go into them here.  I'm going to try to discuss,
     at a high level, the advantages (and disadvantages) of the Protocol,
     however.  As a user of SLOWDOWN, there are some things you should know
     that are discussed here.  I'm also trying to promote the Protocol to
     other programmers, so you'll see a little bit of that bias in here,
     also.  Please bear with me.

     Most people who use DOS very much at all install several TSR's into
     memory at the same time (TSR's like DOSKEY, MSCDEX, and, of course,
     SLOWDOWN).  There are also times when, for various reasons, you may want
     to (or need to) "Disable" a particular TSR.  You may either need to
     Disable it temporarily (and will later want to, or need to, "Enable" it
     again), or you may want to Disable it permanently (and would prefer to
     "Uninstall" it from memory completely).  Unfortunately, many TSR's don't
     have "Enable" or "Disable" Options, and many also do not have
     "Uninstall" Options.

     Even if they do have an "Uninstall" Option, though, it is still possible
     that they cannot be Uninstalled from memory.  It is usually not possible
     to Uninstall a particular TSR unless it was the last TSR installed into
     memory (or at least very close to the last).  You must usually Uninstall
     TSR's in the reverse order they were installed (sometimes called FILO --
     First In, Last Out).

     For example, let's say you have 6 different TSR's in memory, all doing
     different things.  You need to "Disable" TSR #4, but it doesn't have a
     "Disable" Option.  It does have an "Uninstall" Option, but it can't be
     Uninstalled because TSR's 5 & 6 are "in the way".  In order to Uninstall
     TSR #4, you must first Uninstall TSR #6 (if you can), then Uninstall TSR
     #5 (if you can), then Uninstall TSR #4 (we're assuming here that you
     can), then re-install TSR #5 (if you can), then re-install TSR #6 (if
     you can).  Or, you can edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, REMark out the line
     that installs TSR #4, reboot the computer, do the thing you need to do
     without TSR #4, then edit AUTOEXEC.BAT again, un-REMark back in the line
     that installs TSR #4, and reboot again.  Talk about a PAIN!!

     Many years ago, IBM came up with a Protocol that solves this problem
     (and it is the only Protocol I've ever seen that even attempts to solve
     this problem).  IBM calls it the "Interrupt Sharing Protocol".  It is a
     Protocol that allows any TSR to remove itself from memory at any time,
     no matter how many programs were installed after it was.  I think it is
     a very good idea.  Unfortunately, in order for it to work properly, all
     programs should use it (not just some programs, and not just TSR's).
     For some reason, IBM didn't promote the Protocol very much, so not very
     many programmers even know about it, and, as a result, very few programs
     use it.  I consider myself fairly savvy about DOS (I have been writing
     TSR's for nearly a decade), and I first read about this Protocol only a
     few months ago.

     The way "normal" (non-Protocol-using) programs work, you can't "see
     past" the last program installed into memory to be able to modify or
     remove any previously-installed programs.  This Protocol allows you to
     "see through" the later programs to find the early programs, so that
     they can be modified or removed.  If the TSR you're trying to Uninstall
     uses the Protocol, and all of the programs installed AFTER the one
     you're trying to Uninstall also use the Protocol, you can Uninstall the
     TSR with no problem.  It doesn't matter if the TSR's installed BEFORE it
     use the Protocol or not, all that matters is the programs installed
     AFTER it.


     There is one drawback to the Interrupt Sharing Protocol, however.  When
     you Uninstall a particular TSR (if it is not the last program in
     memory), it will leave a "hole" in your memory (where the TSR used to
     be).  If you later decide to re-install the same TSR, it is VERY
     unlikely that it will get installed into the same "hole" it was in
     before.  In fact, it is VERY unlikely that you will be able to use that
     memory hole again for any program -- it will probably be lost (wasted)
     until you reboot the computer again.  If there is even a remote chance
     that you will want to use the TSR again (before you reboot the
     computer), you should simply Disable the TSR instead of Uninstalling it
     from memory completely.  Not all TSR's have Disable/Enable Options, but
     any TSR sophisticated enough to use the Interrupt Sharing Protocol
     probably does.

     If the Protocol is used properly, it allows much greater flexibility in
     when and where and how you use TSR's.  If not used properly, however, it
     can actually end up being less efficient than if you just use TSR's that
     don't implement the Protocol (at least in terms of memory use).  Again,
     if there is even a remote chance that you will want to use the TSR
     again, you should not Uninstall it -- you should simply Disable it.
     Only if you are certain that you will not need the TSR again (at least
     until you reboot the computer) should you attempt to Uninstall it.

     SLOWDOWN is the first program of mine to implement the Protocol
     (SLOWDOWN just happened to be the program I was working on when I
     discovered the Protocol).  I will be updating all of my other programs
     to include the Protocol in the future, however.  If you want more

     I have information there that will allow you to download the Protocol
     details.  You can also look at the source code for SLOWDOWN, which is
     available from my Home Page.  It contains a working implementation of
     the Protocol, as well as some other stuff you might be interested in.

     A WORD FROM THE SPONSOR
     อออออออออออออออออออออออ

     SLOWDOWN is a free program.  If you like it and use it, do something
     nice for someone else in return.  I will accept niceties to myself in
     the form of $, but that is not why I wrote SLOWDOWN.  I wrote it because
     I still have and use several programs that don't work correctly on my
     new, fast computer.  I still haven't yet found a "slowdown" program that
     both does exactly what I want it to do and is free.

     You can freely copy and distribute SLOWDOWN.COM, as long as it is
     distributed along with this SLOWDOWN.DOC, and neither file has been
     modified in any way.  You cannot charge anyone in any way for SLOWDOWN,
     except to recover your actual costs for disks and shipping (you cannot
     charge for "handling").  You do need my permission to distribute
     SLOWDOWN as a "companion" to some other program.


     You can also freely download the source code for SLOWDOWN if you want.
     It is available from my Home Page:

       http://members.aol.com/bretjohn

     I don't include the source code with the program because I want to keep
     the size of the download as small as possible, and because I know most
     people don't care about the source code anyway.  My Home Page contains
     the source code for some of my other programs as well (see "OTHER
     PROGRAMS BY BRET JOHNSON" below, page 42.

     OTHER PROGRAMS BY BRET JOHNSON
     ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     If you like SLOWDOWN, I have written some other programs you may find
     useful.

       CLOCK
          Shows a clock on your screen all the time.  Also has two alarms
          that beep at you when it's time for an appointment.

       JOYKEYS
          Lets you use your joystick with ANY program.

       MOUSKEYS
          Lets you use your mouse with ANY program.

       PRTSCR
          Sends all of your PrintScreens to a file instead of a printer.  A
          good way to transfer data between two programs, even if they won't
          normally "talk" to each other.

       PRTSCRFF
          Modifies your PrintScreen so that each new PrintScreen gets put on
          a new sheet of paper (especially useful if you have a Laser
          printer).

       SCANCODE
          Type keystrokes automatically in the middle of other programs.
          Helpful in getting past the "starting screens" of most programs, or
          to create macros.  Can also be used to remap the keyboard.

       SDWRGMPD
          DOS driver for a Microsoft SideWinder Digital GamePad.

       SERIAL
          Shows the status of your serial (COM) ports on screen.  Shows the
          bit rate, parity, status of the leads (DTR, DSR, etc.).  An
          excellent way to troubleshoot modem problems.

     WARRANTY
     ออออออออ

     There is no warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, supplied
     with SLOWDOWN.  As with any software, especially TSR's, it may or may
     not work with other software that you may have.  I have done my best to
     make sure SLOWDOWN won't screw anything up, but, again, there is no
     guarantee.

     If you find any "bugs" in this program, or see something that you wish
     were different, please let me know.  I can only improve SLOWDOWN if I
     know what you think needs to improve.


     HAVE FUN!

     I intend to always keep the latest versions of all of my programs on my
     own Internet Home Page.  The URL is:

       http://members.aol.com/bretjohn

     This will be the first place to find updates to my programs.  It will be
     the only place I put beta versions of new releases.

     REVISION HISTORY
     ออออออออออออออออ

     1994/10/20  v1.00

     1994/12/21  v1.01
       * Changed a small part of the do-nothing loop that would sometimes
         lock up a computer when a serial port was accessed (such as when a
         mouse was moved).

     2000/05/30  v2.00
       * Converted from a "simulated TSR" using COMMAND.COM to a true TSR.
       * Added Hot-Keys to change Speeds "on-the-fly".
       * Changed the verbiage "Speed" to "Slowdown-Factor".  The old meaning
         of "Speed" was backwards from what people normally think, and very
         often confused them.
       * Added the MHZ, PERCENT, SPEED, REMEMBER-Speed, and TABLE Options.
       * Added longhand forms for Options.
       * Added Windows multi-tasking awareness, and removed the ability to
         Slow Down Windows.
       * Allowed SLOWDOWN to be used on any computer, including XT's
         (previous versions considered an XT already "too slow").
       * Started using the IBM Interrupt Sharing Protocol, which sometimes
         allows SLOWDOWN to be removed from memory even if other programs
         were installed after it.
       * SLOWDOWN should be less "jerky" now when trying to make a really
         fast computer run really slow.
       * Lots and lots of small changes.

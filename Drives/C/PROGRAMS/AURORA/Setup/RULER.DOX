 Insert a Ruler Line

  This macro inserts a ruler line above the current line in an edit
  window. The ruler line appears as:

    +תתתת1תתתת+תתתת2תתתת+תתתת3תתתת+תתתת4תתתת+תתתת5תתתת+תתתת6תתתת+

  Note that the ruler line is a normal text line within the file, and can
  be moved, copied, or deleted like ordinary text.

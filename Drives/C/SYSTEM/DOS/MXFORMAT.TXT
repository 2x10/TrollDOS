      will be extracted to the floppy disk:
      1. MAXLLF.EXE - Maxtor's Low Level Format Utility
      2. MAXLLF.TXT - Text file giving procedures to run MAXLLF.EXE
         Note: MAXLLF.TXT contains this document.

                                       (HELP WINDOW)

Note: A red MESSAGE WINDOW will appear during portions of the utility's execution. The Message 
      Window prompts the user to press a specific key before continuing with the next process. 
      The red MESSAGE WINDOW, will appear between the Main Options and the Current Device 
      Windows.

1. Highlight "Select Device" and press the [Enter] key. The following message will appear in the 
   red MESSAGE WINDOW:

                       Which Device would you like to select? (0,1,2,3)

   The following describes the device numbers:
   *  Device 0 - (primary master)
   *  Device 1 - (primary slave)
   *  Device 2 - (secondary master)
   *  Device 3 - (secondary slave)

2. Type the specific device number and press the [Enter] key.
   After the device number has been properly selected, the Current Device Window will display 
   specific information on the selected hard drive (e.g., drive model, serial number, firmware 
   revision number and the selected hard drive's parameters).

   CAUTION: Be careful when selecting which hard drive to low level format. Improper selection 
            will result in IMMEDIATE data loss on the selected hard drive. Typing a device number
            that is not present in the system will be returned to the Main Menu.

3. From the Main Options Window, select "Low Level Format Current Device" and press the [Enter] 
   key. The following will appear in the red MESSAGE WINDOW:

                   Do you want to use LBA Mode (if not sure, press N) (Y/N)?

   The program default for this is "N" (no), as some older System BIOS's do not support Logical 
   Block Addressing (LBA) Mode.

4. If the hard drive's capacity exceeds 504 MB, type "Y". If the hard drive's capacity does not 
   exceed 504 MB, type "N".

   NOTE: Improper selection will result in the hard drive not formatting correctly.

5. Once the user has selected the method to low level format the device in step 4, the red 
   MESSAGE WINDOW then prompts with:

                Warning!!! All data will be lost. Are you absolutely sure? (Y/N)

   Type "N" or press any other key to return to the Main Menu. Choose this option if not 
   absolutely sure that the selection made in Step 4 was correct  -  OR  - type "Y" to start the 
   low level format program.

   During the execution of the low level format program:
   *  A digital readout will be displayed in the red MESSAGE WINDOW
   *  The Help Window will display "Press the [Esc] key to low level. . ."

WARNING:  Typing "Y" will start the execution of the Low Level Format program and IMMEDIATELY 
          DESTROY THE DATA ON THE DEVICE.

   To terminate the execution of the Low Level Format program press the [Esc] key. If the program
   is stopped data on the hard drive is lost even if only the first sector of the drive is low 
   level formatted. This will return the program to the Main Menu.

   The low level format will take between 4 and 30 minutes, depending on the capacity and the 
   speed of the hard drive, and the speed of the computer and it's interface.

   Upon successful completion of the low level format of the hard drive, the red MESSAGE WINDOW 
   displays the following message:
   *  The Low Level format completed with no errors.
   *  Press a key to return to the main menu.

Note: If any error is encountered and MAXLLF.EXE returns an Error Code, contact Maxtor Technical 
      Assistance at 1-800-2MAXTOR for further help.

6. Press the [Esc] key (or press any other key) to return to the Main Menu.

7. Select "EXIT" and press the [Enter] key close the low level format utility. This will return 
   the user to the operating system's command prompt.

8. If the format completes with No-Errors, partition and high level format using the operating 
   system.

ÿÿTEMPLATE.AML
 ÿTemplate Editingÿ

  This macro installs or removes Template Editing.

  Template editing allows you to include commonly-used blocks of text or
  source code (called 'templates') in the current edit window with just
  a few keystrokes. Templates can also be defined to be specific to one
  or more file extensions, and may contain embedded macro expressions.

  Templates are defined in the data file Template.dat. See Template.dat
  for detailed instructions.

ÿÿSTATUS.AML
 ÿCustom Status Line Exampleÿ

  This macro adds a custom status line to all edit windows on the
  desktop, and also to any new edit windows as they are opened. Running
  this macro a second time will restore the default status line.

  The status line can be customized by modifying the <status> event in
  Status.aml.
